Nesting of REDD+ Initiatives: Manual for Policymakers82
As a complementary resource, please consider the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) Glossary of T erms (April 
2020), which can be accessed here.
Annex I Countries:  A term used under UNFCCC; it includes the industrialized countries that were members of 
OECD (the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) in 1992, plus countries with economies in 
transition (the EIT Parties), including the Russian Federation, the Baltic States, and several Central and Eastern 
European States.
Article 6 Transactions:  The transfer of ERs in the form of  International Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) 
under Article 6.2 (collaborative approaches) or Article 6.4 (mechanism to support sustainable development) of the 
Paris Agreement. 
Article 6 Projects : Projects that serve to pilot Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, and that require a corresponding 
adjustment (CA) in order to be allocated to projects from national performance. These are pilots in anticipation 
of meeting the requirements of Article 6. Examples include pilot projects promoted by Japan in Cambodia and 
Switzerland in Peru. 
Benefits:  Monetary and/or nonmonetary support received for participation in forest carbon projects, or a 
jurisdictional ER program. 
Benefit sharing:  Refers specifically to the arrangement by which a government institution allocates, administers, 
and channels benefits funded by payments for emission reductions to national actors.  
Carbon credit:  An ER that has been created according to the rules of a private or public carbon standard and is 
issued, tradable, and traceable, in a GHG registry. 
Carbon finance:  A subcategory of result-based finance (RBF) that involves the issuance of tradable carbon credits.
Carbon rights: The rights of communities and individuals to forest-related ERs. When used in the context of 
REDD+, carbon rights are mostly understood as the right to benefit from ERs or to participate in a REDD+ benefit-
sharing system.
Carbon unit: Carbon credits, emissions allowances, or any other unit linked to GHG markets that is issued, 
tradable, and traceable in a GHG registry.
Compliance carbon market  : A regulated market that by law holds entities accountable for their GHG emissions. 
The regulatory regime that covers the compliance market can be set up at the national, regional, or international 
levels.
Corresponding adjustment (CA):  An accounting adjustment made to reflect the use of ITMOs toward an NDC under 
Article 4 of the Paris Agreement or other international system, such as ICAO’s CORSIA. 
Crediting: The accounting of ERs against a forest reference emission level  (FREL), or project baseline.
Data management system (DMS:) A system that systematically records and monitors project, program, and 
transaction information to ensure transparency and consistency. 
APPENDIX A: GLOSSARY

--- PÁGINA 92 ---

Nesting of REDD+ Initiatives: Manual for Policymakers83
Deforestation:  The conversion of forest land to other land uses.
Domestic compliance market: GHG emissions trading systems established in the national context with the goal of 
reducing GHG emissions.
Double counting:  Under the Paris Agreement, this refers to the accounting of a GHG emission reduction or removal 
toward more than one nationally determined contribution (NDC).
Emission reduction (ER) program: A program under which a government is seeking to claim GHG ERs at a 
jurisdictional scale, and access financial rewards for such a program. ER programs—for example under the FCPF 
Carbon Fund, ART TREES, and VCS JNR—have a set of requirements that must be met in order to be considered 
as a jurisdictional program. 
Environmental integrity: A carbon market-based mechanism has environmental integrity if the transfer of credits 
through that mechanism leads to the same, or lower , aggregated global emissions. Integrity is ensured through 
accounting that avoids double-counting (that is, using the same unit twice to offset emissions), as well as 
through the quality of the ER baseline or reference level estimates, additionality, permanence, uncertainty, and 
leakage.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and removals (ERs) refers to a tonne of greenhouse gas expressed in 
CO2e measured against a reference level or baseline that has been avoided (emission reduction) or sequestered 
(removal), often defined with reference to a carbon standard. In this report, we focus on forest-related ERs in 
relation to avoided deforestation (AD) and REDD+.
Forest degradation : Reduction in the capacity of a forest to produce ecosystem services such as carbon storage 
as a result of anthropogenic activities.
Forest reference emission level (FREL):  A benchmark for emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
(REDD only).
Incentives:  Government-set, market-based incentives to reduce GHG emissions and implement REDD+ activities.
International transferred mitigation outcome (ITMO): Emissions reductions and removals through a cooperative 
approach under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which involves the international transfer of mitigation 
outcomes authorized for use toward an NDC; or mitigation outcomes authorized by a participating party for use 
under an international system other than for achievement of its NDC, such as ICAO’s CORSIA.
Jurisdictional: A governance level that covers an administrative area for which public authorities can take 
decisions (for example, the national or federal level, subnational states, regions, counties or departments, 
municipalities, and/or communities).
Nesting:  The coordinated and harmonized implementation of REDD+ programs and activities at multiple 
accounting scales and governance levels within a country.
Nationally determined contribution (NDC) : The pledge made by a party to the Paris Agreement, communicated to 
the UNFCCC Secretariat, to take climate action.   
REDD+ The international policy framework that provides incentives for reduced emissions from deforestation 
and forest degradation, and promotes the role of conservation, the sustainable management of  forests, and 
enhancement of  forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+).
Program  or REDD+ program: Policies and activities that generate forest-related ERs. 
Project or REDD+ project: A forest carbon project-level activity that is accredited, or that is seeking accreditation 
under a carbon accounting standard. 
Results-based finance (RBF) : Payments for results (mostly in the form of ERs), which may or may not involve the 
issuance of tradable carbon credits.

Nesting of REDD+ Initiatives: Manual for Policymakers84
Right and title to ERs:  Rights defined on the basis of a contract (for example, the FCPF ERPA) or a law (for 
example, local emission-trading legislation) that assigns a transferable right to an ER. 
Safeguards: Measures to prevent and mitigate harm to people and the environment, and to increase benefits for 
them in the context of REDD+ activities. 
Subnational: A region within a country that has its own system of governance, such as a province, state, or 
municipality.
Transaction registry:  An online database that issues, records, transfers, and tracks the carbon units that are 
exchanged within carbon finance market mechanisms.
Voluntary carbon market:  Transactions in ERs and carbon credits that are not generated or acquired with the 
intention of surrendering them into a regulated carbon market.

Nesting of REDD+ Initiatives: Manual for Policymakers85
This appendix shows decision makers  how to use the accompanying Decision Support T ool (DST) for nesting 
REDD+ initiatives at various scales.  
The Decision Support T ool (DST) that accompanies this manual is intended to assist countries in identifying gaps 
that may exist in the implementation of their REDD model or nesting system.94 Identification of these gaps may 
serve as the basis for a roadmap with concrete actions to take toward definition of the country’s nested system.
Two categories of countries are expected to use this tool:
·	 Countries with no prior experience with REDD+ nesting initiatives. The information presented in this 
manual can be used to identify various approaches to the nesting of REDD+ initiatives, specific to the 
country’s context ; and to identify gaps that will need to be overcome in designing the system.
·	 Countries with experience in implementing REDD+ nesting initiatives could use the manual to review 
their progress, with a view toward identifying gaps or strengthening design elements in order to scale 
up implementation.
The DST guides users through the following steps:
Step 1: Helps the user understand broadly which nesting model is most desirable for a given country, and 
whether a centralized, decentralized, or nested model is best. This is achieved through six simple questions that 
help to identify the country’s objectives vis-à-vis nesting. 
Step 2: Based on the answers to the questions in Step 1, the country selects the model that it wishes to evaluate. 
They then evaluate their level of progress toward, or completion of a set of actions conducive to the development 
of all the important elements to consider for a nesting system.
The tool is based in MS Excel, and has been organized under five different tabs. 
All users will have to use the tabs named “Readme” and “Questions. ” The answers to the Questions tab will serve 
to identify the nesting model that is most appropriate for a given country. T o achieve this, the user needs to 
provide an answer to each of the six questions presented. Once all of the questions have been answered, based on 
the responses received, the DST will provide a recommendation on the most appropriate nesting model. 
The remaining tabs, (“Jurisdictional ER program, ” “Centralized Nested, ” Decentralized Nested, ” and “Project 
Crediting Only”) describe the elements of each REDD+ implementation model, as well as which actions are 
needed in order to implement the relevant model. The elements cover all of the issues necessary to establish the 
recommended nested system (MRV, carbon rights, benefit sharing, consultations, safeguards, and institutional 
elements), as well as registry and regulatory issues. As users check the boxes of the tasks that have been 
completed, the progress made toward the various elements is automatically updated in a dashboard at the top 
of the tab, providing graphic information about the country’s degree of development toward a desired REDD+ 
implementation model.
