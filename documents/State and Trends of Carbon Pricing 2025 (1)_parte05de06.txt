Clarity on Article 
6.2 and guidance 
on its operation 
has strengthened 
the basis for 
using bilateral 
transactionsCountries have agreed to a path forward to generate 
credits under the UN’s new crediting mechanism. Two 
important standards were endorsed at COP29 to advance 
the PACM—the centralized UN-administered crediting 
mechanism (more in Box 10): the standard for developing 
and assessing methodologies;99 and the standard on 
requirements for activities involving carbon removals.100 
The Supervisory Body of the Mechanism—the authority 
overseeing the PACM—plans to release the first eligible 
methodologies in the second half of 2025, which is the 
first step to creating supply from new projects under the 
mechanism. These will include revised Clean Development 
Mechanism (CDM)xiimethodologies,xviii such as for activities 
relating to grid-connected renewable electricity generation, 
thermal energy production, flaring or use of landfill gas, and 
energy efficiency measures for non-renewable biomass.101 
Agreement was also reached on the required functionalities 
of the registries to be operated under both the Article 6.2 
mechanism (which allows for bilateral/multilateral trading 
of credits between countries) and the PACM.102 Clarity on 
Article 6.2 and guidance on its operation has strengthened 
the basis for using bilateral transactions. These agreements 
gathered momentum throughout 2024, with 20 new 
bilateral agreements being signed or negotiated, bringing 
the total to about 100 agreements.103 
xviii The CDM was a flexibility mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol and the first international crediting mechanism.

BOX 10
COP29 decisions on Article 6
At COP29, the final rules for Article 6.2 (cooperative approaches) and 
Article 6.4 (the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism) were adopted. 
These rules provide clarity on the operationalization of international 
carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. 
On Article 6.2, agreement was reached on technical details—
providing greater certainty on operationalizing country-to-country 
transfers. In particular, agreement was reached on the procedures and 
requirements for authorization of internationally transferred mitigation 
outcomes (ITMOs)—that is where host governments agree to domestic 
mitigation to be transferred to another party. The COP29 outcome 
clarified, however, that the initial act of authorization does not necessarily 
immediately commit the host country to apply a corresponding 
adjustment. A corresponding adjustment is only required after the point 
of “first transfer,” which the host country can choose to be: (i) when 
authorization is given, (ii) when the credit is issued, or (iii) when the 
authorized credit (ITMO) is used or cancelled by the buyer. Importantly, 
after the point of first transfer, no further changes to the authorization 
status are allowed unless explicitly permitted in the authorization terms. 
Authorizations must furthermore specify critical elements to ensure 
transparency and legal clarity, such as the uses of credits covered by the 
authorization and terms for changing the authorization (e.g., withdrawal, 
changes to the authorized volume of credits, etc.) The COP29 decision also delivered more clarity on the 
operationalization of the PACM. Two key standards were endorsed 
(on methodologies and removals), and the COP29 decision clarified 
outstanding issues including on authorizations and the registry for 
tracking units. With the main regulatory documents and standards 
now in place, the PACM Supervisory Body and the Methodological 
Expert Panel can now focus on developing standards, procedures, and 
tools. These will provide additional clarity on technical issues, such as 
accounting for emissions leakage, post-crediting period monitoring 
requirements, and how to address non-permanence and reversal 
risks. Further, revisions to six methodologies (referenced above) are 
ongoing, and the first PACM methodologies are expected in the second 
half of 2025. In February 2025, the PACM Supervisory Body also approved 
the procedure for the operation of the mechanism’s registry, including 
developing an interim registry modeled on the registry used under the 
Clean Development Mechanism. This interim registry will allow PACM 
credits (known as A6.4ERs) to be issued and tracked until the full PACM 
registry is available. User access to the interim registry is pending the 
development of additional user guidance by the UNFCCC secretariat.

Approximately 
1,500 activities 
registered under 
the CDM are 
looking to transition 
to the PACMFuture supply from international crediting mechanisms 
will originate from transitioning and new projects. 
Transitioning CDM projects will supply the first carbon 
credits issued under the new PACM. Approximately 1,500 
activities registered under the CDM are looking to transition 
to the PACM, with the first tranche of credits expected to 
be issued in the second half of 2025.104 While the potential 
volume of these carbon credits could be close to 1 billion 
tCO2e, actual supply is likely to be considerably lower, given 
that credit issuance requires host country approval and 
projects must successfully complete the issuance process 
to retroactively claim historical emissions reductions 
delivered in the period 2021 to 2025. The retroactive nature 
of the credits and concerns around the environmental 
integrity of some activities may make this supply less 
attractive to buyers, who may instead consider new 
(greenfield) PACM projects using methodologies approved 
by the Supervisory Body of the Mechanism. As of April 1, 
2025, over 1,000 new programs and projects had notifiedxixxiii 
the UN of the intention to submit new projects to the 
mechanism. This early pipeline of programs and projects 
shows a broad geographical diversity. While historically large 
credit-supplying countries, like Brazil and India, continue to 
be well represented in the list of potential PACM projects, 
other regions with less success under the CDM (e.g., Sub-
Saharan African countries including Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, 
and Zambia) are showing an expanding pipeline of new 
activities.105
xix This relates to “prior consideration” notifications to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change secretariat, which is the first step for project developers to 
demonstrate that their climate change mitigation activities have considered the financial benefits of the PACM prior to the start of implementation.

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202564
3.3 Carbon credit prices generally declined, but credits 
with specific attributes continued to attract price 
premiums
Carbon credit prices fell for most project categories in 
2024, but nature-based removals displayed resilience. 
Exchange-traded credit prices declined for most project 
categories during 2024 (Figure 18). The two largest project 
categories (measured by annual issuance volumes), avoided 
deforestation, and renewable energy, experienced sharp 
declines in exchange-traded prices between April 2023 and 
April 2024.106 Prices for avoided deforestation rebounded 
to USD 5.30 per tCO2e as of April 1, 2025.107 Last year’s 
ICVCM methodology decisions may have contributed to the 
price declines for credits from renewable energy projects—
exchange-traded prices fell by nearly one-third following 
the ICVCM’s rejection of renewable energy methodologies 
in August 2024. Exchange-traded prices for nature-based 
removals were more resilient, increasing throughout 2024 
and closing at around USD 15.50 per tCO2e on April 1, 2025. 
Changes in prices for credits traded over the counter (OTC) 
were more varied, but in general prices were lower—the 
average OTC price reported by Ecosystem Marketplace for 
2024 was USD 6.78 per tCO2e (about 6% below 2023 average 
prices). 
Note: Prices are based on monthly and yearly averages of the price assessments from Platts, S&P Global Commodity Insights (2025), provided by 
S&P Global.FIGURE 18

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202565
OTC credit prices for some project types fell significantly, 
such as renewable energy credits, which were more than 
30% lower than in 2023. At the same time, credits from 
household devices, energy efficiency, and fuel switching 
displayed notable increases (Figure 19). OTC prices for all 
credit types attracted a premium compared to prices traded 
through standardized, exchange-traded contracts. Nature-
based removal credits continued to receive a premium over 
credits from avoided emissions projects (such as REDD+), 
suggesting a reluctance from buyers to bid for credits from 
avoided emissions projects. Additionally, forward prices 
for nature-based removals commonly exceeded USD 20 
per tCO2e, suggesting a bullish outlook for these activity 
types.108
 
Note: This figure illustrates the exchange-traded and OTC prices of carbon credits. Prices are based on monthly and yearly averages of the price 
assessments provided by Platts, S&P Global Commodity Insights, 2025. The Platts assessment reflects bids, offers, and trades for credits as 
reported in the Platts Market on Close assessment process, in the brokered market, or on trading and exchange platforms. For each of its price 
assessments Platts has identified a reference base to represent fungible credits across each market segment, considering certification, vintage, 
volume, and the Sustainable Development Goals. For the nature-based projects, a weighted average of Platts nature-based avoidance price and 
Platts nature-based removals price is used, rather than a singular price assessment. Adjustments are made for credits that vary from this base, 
normalizing values based on factors like technology, certification standards, geography, and additional benefits to align them with the market 
value of the reference base. OTC prices were provided by Ecosystem Marketplace and updated as of February 26, 2025. OTC prices represent 
volume-weighted yearly averages of carbon credit trades in the voluntary carbon markets. Discrepancies may exist in project categorizations 
between the exchange-traded and OTC data due to different source methodologies. See Annex C, Definitions, for a detailed note on the carbon 
credit categorizations used in this figure. Details on Platts’s assessments can be found in the Platts’ Specification Guide.FIGURE 19

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202566
Buyers’ willingness 
to pay for 
perceived high-
integrity credits 
is increasingly 
translating into 
price premiumsCredit prices point to a strengthening correlation 
between quality and price—credits with a perceived 
higher quality trade at a premium. Buyers’ willingness 
to pay for perceived high-integrity credits—defined as 
those receiving favorable ratings from carbon credit rating 
agencies—is increasingly translating into price premiums. 
Reporting from carbon credit rating agencies suggests a 
positive correlation between their proprietary quality ratings 
and carbon credit prices, albeit using data drawn from small 
sample sizes. For example, rating agency analysis suggests 
that buyers of nature-based removal credits paid a premium 
of up to USD 5 per credit for each increase in the rating 
band, while other analyses suggest a price premium of 40% 
for a higher-rated band.109 
There is an observed price premium for credits eligible 
to be used for NDC achievement and international 
compliance markets relative to voluntary markets. The 
price of credits transacted under Article 6.2 and CORSIA’s 
phase 1 surpassed USD 20 per tCO2e. For example, 
Switzerland reported paying an average price of 29 Swiss 
francs per tCO2e (over USD 30 per tCO2e) for Article 6.2 
credits to be delivered between 2022 and 2030.110 Similarly, 
in February 2025, Singapore conducted a tender process 
to procure Article 6.2 credits generated between 2021 and 
2030 from nature-based projects. The tender attracted 
almost 20 offers, with prices ranging from USD 18 to over 
USD 40 per tCO2e.111 The premium may partly reflect that, in 
many jurisdictions, project developers must cover additional 
costs to obtain host country government approval and the 
opportunity cost that the jurisdiction incurs by providing a 
corresponding adjustment. Credits eligible under CORSIA’s phase 1 also attracted buyer interest. IATA’s procurement 
event in early 2025 saw 11 airlines purchasing eligible credits 
at a fixed-price offering of USD 21.70 per tCO2e.112 The total 
volume of these initial purchases was not made public, 
but all transacted credits are from a jurisdictional REDD+ 
Architecture for REDD+ Transactions TREES program in 
Guyana—the only source of phase 1 eligible credits at that 
time. In March 2025, a second procurement event was 
organized by IATA, with several new buyers engaging and 
eligible credits selling at USD 22.25 per tCO2e. These recent 
prices exceeded 2024 average prices, with exchange-traded 
phase 1 eligible credits mostly fluctuating between USD 11 
and USD 20 per tCO2e last year.

ANNEX C
Definitions
Carbon pricing
Carbon pricing seeks to align the costs of consuming carbon-intensive fuels 
or using carbon-intensive processes with the social costs of those activities. 
If well designed and sufficiently ambitious, carbon pricing creates economic 
incentives to shift investments, production, and consumption toward low-
carbon alternatives, drives clean technological innovation, and reduces the 
need for additional public spending. Carbon pricing can help raise revenues 
in a more efficient and less distortive way than alternative options, such as 
labor taxes, while delivering numerous benefits to society beyond climate 
mitigation. Carbon pricing is an important policy tool that can be used as part of 
a comprehensive policy package to decarbonize economies.
Direct carbon pricing
Direct carbon pricing is implemented to reduce GHG emissions by providing 
a price signal closely linked to actual emissions. Direct carbon pricing 
instruments are categorized as “compliance” instruments or “carbon 
crediting” mechanisms. Under compliance instruments (such as emissions 
trading systems or carbon taxes), covered entities are obligated to pay for the 
emissions from covered activities. Participation in carbon crediting on the other 
hand is voluntary, with participants earning credits in recognition of quantified 
and verified emissions reductions or removals.
Indirect carbon pricing
Indirect carbon pricing refers to instruments that change the price of products 
associated with carbon emissions in ways that are not directly proportional 
to the relative emissions associated with those products. These instruments 
provide a carbon price signal, even though they are often (primarily) adopted for other socioeconomic objectives, such as raising public revenues or addressing 
air pollution. Examples of indirect carbon pricing include fuel and commodity 
taxes, as well as fossil fuel subsidies affecting energy consumers. For example, 
fuel excise taxes apply a tax to the volume of fuels, such as gasoline and 
diesel (e.g., dollars per liter), which places a price on the carbon emissions 
from the combustion of those fuels. However, the price is not determined in 
proportion to the relative emissions resulting from the combustion of those 
fuels. Conversely, fuel subsidies that reduce the price of fossil fuels create a 
“negative” indirect carbon price signal, which incentivizes higher consumption 
and therefore increases carbon emissions.
While carbon pricing policies can be categorized as direct or indirect, in 
practice, the distinction is not always obvious. The most direct carbon 
pricing policy would apply an equivalent and proportional incentive to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors and fuels. Indirect carbon pricing 
policies still create a price signal that applies to fossil fuels or products, but 
they are not designed to apply a consistent price across emissions from 
different sources (e.g., the price is not linked to actual GHG emissions or the 
carbon content of fuels). ETSs, carbon taxes, and carbon crediting are direct 
carbon pricing policies, but in reality, all examples of these policies currently in 
operation differ across sectors, fuels, activities, and/or gases. As a result, the 
distinction between direct and indirect carbon prices is less stark in practice, 
and carbon pricing policies sit on a spectrum from direct to indirect.

Term category Term Definitions
Carbon pricing 
instruments Emissions trading 
systemIn an ETS, the government places a limit on the amount of GHG emissions from covered entities. Entities must surrender emission 
units (or “allowances”) to cover their emissions within a compliance period. Each emission unit represents the right to emit a 
certain volume of emissions (typically 1 tCO2e) and can be traded between covered entities or sometimes with other traders. There 
are several different types of ETSs, including “cap-and-trade” and “rate-based” approaches, and different terms are used for the 
emission units within different systems. The carbon price in these systems is usually a function of supply and demand for emission 
units.
Carbon tax Through a carbon tax a government levies a fee on covered entities for their GHG emissions, providing a financial incentive to 
reduce emissions. Under a carbon tax, the government sets the price of emissions (the tax rate). The resulting volume of emissions 
reductions achieved by the policy is determined by the response of the emitting entities to the set price.
Carbon crediting 
mechanismUnder a carbon crediting mechanism, tradable credits (each representing 1 tCO2e) are generated through voluntary mitigation 
activities that avoid (preventing GHGs from being released, such as capturing methane from landfills) or remove (extracting GHG 
from the atmosphere, for instance through afforestation that sequesters carbon) emissions. These credits are issued following 
established protocols designed to ensure that each credit corresponds to a real and measurable reduction or removal. 
Once issued, carbon credits can be sold, creating a source of revenue for the project. While carbon crediting mechanisms create a 
source of supply, they rely on a separate source of demand for credits in order to deliver a financial incentive to reduce emissions. 
Demand for credits can come from compliance instruments (e.g., businesses regulated under an ETS or a carbon tax that allows the 
use of offsets, countries meeting nationally determined contribution targets under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC), or voluntary offsetting.
Types of carbon 
crediting 
mechanismsInternational crediting 
mechanismMechanisms managed or administered by an international organization, including those established with authority of national 
governments, such as UN agencies. This category includes the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism.
Independent crediting 
mechanismMechanisms administered by a nongovernmental organization, such as Verra and Gold Standard.
Governmental 
crediting mechanismMechanisms administered by one or more governments, such as the California Compliance Offset Program and the Australian 
Carbon Credit Unit Scheme. 
Status Under consideration A government has announced its intention to work toward the implementation of a carbon pricing instrument and this has been 
formally confirmed by official sources.
Under development A government is actively working toward the implementation of a specific carbon pricing instrument (for example, a mandate may 
have been established, but regulated entities do not yet face compliance obligations, or no credits have been issued) and this has 
been formally confirmed by official government sources.
Implemented The instrument is in full operation. For a compliance instrument, the carbon pricing instrument has been formally adopted through 
legislation and compliance obligations are in force and enforced. For crediting, credits have been issued (or have frameworks in 
place to allow credits to be used domestically) and activities are ongoing.

Sectoral coverage 
statusCovered Point-source emissions from this sector are generally subject to compliance obligations (even if the regulation may apply to entities 
upstream or downstream from the emissions point source) or eligible for crediting. Some emissions from the sector may not be 
eligible or covered, for example if there are exemptions or exclusions for a particular GHG.
Covered in principle Some point-source emissions from this sector are covered, but in practice the share of emissions covered is very low. The low 
coverage rate is usually due to non-sector-specific exclusions such as certain fuels or gases being exempt, most entities in the 
sector falling below relevant thresholds for participation, or most entities already being covered by another initiative.
Not covered No point-source emissions from the sector are covered.
Sectors covered 
by a compliance 
carbon pricing 
instrument Electricity and heat Emissions resulting from fuels burned in facilities primarily producing electricity or heat for shared use. 
Industry Emissions produced by industrial facilities including manufacturing, metal production, fertilizer production. Includes emissions from 
fuel used for energy in these facilities as well as emissions from industrial processes.
Mining and extractives Emissions from mines, rigs, and fuel processing. Includes emissions from fuel used for energy in these facilities as well as fugitive 
emissions.
Transport Emissions resulting from fuels burned for energy in the service of moving people or goods (e.g., road, rail) except for aviation.
Aviation Emissions resulting from fuels burned in the aviation sector. 
Buildings Emissions resulting from fuels burned for energy in residential, commercial, and public sector buildings.
Agriculture, forestry, 
and fishing fuel useEmissions resulting from fuels burned for energy in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors.
Agricultural emissions Emissions resulting from agricultural processes like livestock and fertilizer use. Excludes fuel use and land-use, land-use change, 
and forestry.
Waste Emissions resulting from waste management facilities including incineration of waste, methane or CO2 produced from landfills, etc. 
Excludes fuel use.
Land-use, land-use 
change, and forestryEmissions (or removals) resulting from changes to carbon sinks in plants and soils.
