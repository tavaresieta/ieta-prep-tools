IETA VCM GUIDELINES 2.0
However, the gap between climate commit -
ments and the 1.5°C pathway is growing, and 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) shows the world is on track for a tem -
perature rise of over 3°C. If the world is to lim -
it warming to 1.5°C, the IPCC has stated that 
global emissions must peak now, almost halve 
by 2030 and that removals must be deployed at 
considerable scale.1 
Y et, since publishing version 1.0 of IETA’s “Guide -
lines for high-integrity use of carbon credits”2 in 
April 2024, an increasing body of research has emerged indicating that, while some progress 
towards corporate net zero is being made, com -
panies overall are behind in their climate targets. 
This under delivery is contributing to the risk of overshoot of the Paris Agreement objectives 
and raises ongoing concern in IETA. Although 
these research studies follow different method -
ological approaches, they draw the same broad conclusions: 
a) The majority of companies have not set net zero targets
3 4 5  
b) There is growing concerns that companies with net zero targets are not on track to meet both near- and long-term targets
6 7 8  
c) Delivery of scope 3 targets is particularly challenging
9 10 11   Even if all companies set Paris aligned targets, 
the risk of missing targets will continue to ex -
ist. In this regard, the voluntary carbon market 
(VCM) is an essential mechanism for companies to decarbonise as fast as possible in the most cost-effective way. In a report released by the 
Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative (VCMI)
12 this 
year, companies stated that carbon markets are 
a critical element to meeting climate and sus -
tainability goals with “Making progress towards climate goals” ranked as the top opportunity. IETA has outlined the following Guidelines 
which we believe offer a pragmatic approach to 
the high integrity use of verified carbon credits (VCCs) by companies as a complement to in -
ternal decarbonisation efforts. The IETA Guide -
lines V1.0 were first published in April 2024
13 and 
updated in September 2025. 
In 2025, there remains a lack of consensus in 
guidelines and standards on the ‘use cases’ for VCCs to support Net Zero delivery. In the same VCMI report as referenced earlier, businesses 
conclude “clear, aligned and stable rules wheth -
er from regulatory or voluntary frameworks, are 
the critical levers to justify larger scale invest -
ment into the market”. 01 INTRODUCTION

IETA VCM GUIDELINES 2.06
It is encouraging to note that we are starting to 
see some alignment with IETA’s view, as set out in the IETA Guidelines V1.0, that the use case for 
VCCs should include helping companies stay 
on track and meeting interim internal emissions reduction targets.
14 15 The Guidelines continue to 
build on existing and emerging guidance as we work towards a consensus in the market on the 
high integrity use cases for VCCs to help meet 
net zero commitments and the claims that com -
panies can make based on their use. 
These Guidelines were developed by and for 
companies who are committed to climate ac-tion and decarbonising their businesses. IETA’s mission is to “Empower business to engage in climate action and pursue net zero ambitions to 
advance the Paris Agreement’s objectives”.
16 At 
this critical stage, it is fundamental that compa -
nies seeking to engage in climate action, reduce emissions and reach net zero, maximise all avail -
able solutions. IETA encourages all c ompanies 
to (1) set Paris Agreement aligned net zero tar -gets, (2) compensate with VCCs for some or all 
of their unabated emissions
17, be they scope 1, 
2 or 3, during their net zero pathway as well as to counterbalance their residual emissions
18 at 
net zero and beyond, and (3) contribute to the global effort to meet net zero by contributing to 
emissions mitigation beyond their own net zero 
pathway. 
These Guidelines are intended to outline IE -
TA’s position on best practices when leveraging 
the VCM to ensure high integrity use cases of VCCs. In this regard, we identified multiple use cases for VCCs that companies can follow to support their internal decarbonisation efforts, 
with a focus on the use of VCCs to meet interim 
internal emissions reduction targets as the main driver for companies to invest in VCCs and the use case with the highest mitigation potential.
19 
IETA supports companies using both high-qual -
ity emission reductions and removals VCCs in 
their decarbonisation pathway and to reach and 
maintain net zero.

MAKING NET ZERO POSSIBLE7
Carbon markets (compliance and voluntary), 
funded by companies and governments, can play a role in delivering the Paris Agreement 
Goals. International carbon markets could re -
duce GHG mitigation costs by up to 32%.
21 IETA 
acknowledges the importance of the adaptation 
component of the Paris Agreement and firm -
ly believes carbon markets can help drive the much-needed climate finance, technology and capacity to the low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMIC) and most vulnerable com -
munities helping to close the finance gap and support the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG) .
More specifically the VCM, that is “the use of 
VCCs that are not purchased with the intention 
to surrender into an active regulated, compli -
ance carbon market” ,
22 has a unique role to play 
in paving the way for compliance markets, facili -
tating the achievement of NDCs and encourag -
ing private investment in decarbonisation and achievement of Paris aligned net zero. As a run -
way towards compliance, the VCM helps build capacity and knowledge for governments and 
companies on the best practices for registries, 
verification, project development and financing mechanisms. The agility of the VCM offers on -
going opportunities for development, technol-ogy innovation and additional forms of climate 
mitigation.
In a 2023 Capstone report  by IETA and the 
University of Maryland,
23 modelling showed 
that in the near-term, cooperative implemen -
tation of Nationally Determined Contributions 
(“NDCs”) using Article 6 could substantially re-
duce resources needed to achieve emissions reductions. Given the lack of finance to address climate change, this outcome highlights the sig -nificant role of VCCs to allow countries to reach their NDCs. Building on this report, further eco -
nomic modelling was conducted,
24 indicating 
that the VCM has a potentially important role to play in enabling emissions mitigation in the near 
term, and that the role of the VCM will fade as 
the world approaches net zero. The VCM plays a larger role transferring resources to the LL -
MICs than when NDCs are implemented inde -
pendently.
The VCM can also channel finance to where it 
is desperately needed, including to LLMICs, removals (both nature-based and technolo-
gy-based), environmental conservation, and for 
delivery of the UN SDGs.
25 Recent research into 
corporate net zero and the use of VCCs coming from independent research providers (such as 
Sylvera,
26 MSCI,27 Ecosystem Marketplace,28 
AlliedOffsets and Bain & Company29), together 
with the experience of IETA members, shows 
that VCCs can accelerate and increase climate 
action, at the lowest cost. 
Despite this critical role, the VCM has under -
performed. Since 2022, voluntary retirement of 
VCCs has levelled off. This stagnation jeopardis -
es progress toward global targets and under -
scores the urgent need to revive business de -
mand for VCCs. While companies view carbon 
markets as essential to achieving their climate 
and sustainability objectives, recent concerns 
about reputational risk, litigation, VCC quality, and inconsistencies in regulatory and voluntary frameworks on how VCCs can be used in corpo -
rate decarbonisation strategies and the claims that may be made in respect of retirements, have made many companies hesitant to invest, and slowed down decarbonisation.THE VCM CHANNELS

CARBON MARKET (VCM)
THE VCM CAN PROVIDE A ROBUST MECHANISM FOR COMPANIES TO REDUCE OR REMOVE EMIS -
SIONS IN SUPPORT OF GLOBAL DECARBONISATION. PURCHASE OF VCC s PLACES AN INTERNAL 
PRICE ON CARBON, WHICH ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO MAKE DECARBONISATION EFFORTS  
IN THEIR VALUE CHAIN. COMPANIES PARTICIPATING IN THE VCM ARE INVESTING THREE TIMES 
MORE IN EMISSIONS REDUCTION EFFORTS WITHIN THEIR VALUE CHAINS COMPARED TO NON-  
PARTICIPANTS.20 

--- PÁGINA 8 ---

IETA VCM GUIDELINES 2.08
A report by VCMI30 clearly found that the top two 
drivers for the use of VCCs by companies are: 
1. making progress towards climate goals and, 
2. demonstrating action across broader social 
and nature goals. The report confirmed that cor -
porates are willing to invest in VCCs to support market and technology innovation, stay ahead 
of regulatory, compliance and reporting risks, 
access revenue opportunities and investments, enhance brand reputation and have better man-agement of financial cost and risks. However, as stated above, multiple concerns are stalling in-
vestment and trust in the market.
The urgency of the climate crisis requires sig -
nificant action now. Science-based pathways 
that make sense on paper are in themselves not 
enough – actions are critical.
2. 1 U SE OF VERIFIED CARBON
 CREDI TS (VCC s) IN CORPORATE 
 DECARBONISATION
In developing these Guidelines, IETA builds on an extensive body of existing work within the VCM. Several parties – both private and public 
sector – are developing guidelines, standards 
and regulations related to the use of VCCs in corporate decarbonisation strategies (Figure 1). 
As illustrated in Figure 1, it is best practice 
across frameworks to emphasise a focus on emissions reductions first and foremost; most operational frameworks take this a step further by not allowing carbon credit use for meeting 
interim internal emissions reduction targets 
or demonstrating progress on the path of net zero. This is unfortunately a missed opportunity to drive additional climate finance to emission 
reductions and avoid missing targets. At net 
zero, most frameworks emphasise the need to counterbalance residual emissions with durable 
removals VCCs. Insetting,  voluntary retirement 
as contributions, and  infrastructure scaling  are 
emerging use cases for VCCs. 
Existing frameworks provide limited use cases 
for VCCs. T o provide impactful action towards 
NDC delivery and corporate decarbonisation, organisations need an effective business case for the use of VCCs in corporate net zero strat -
egies, e.g. using them to balance emissions that cannot otherwise be eliminated on the path to net zero. IETA differs from many frameworks as members view the primary incentive for com-panies to voluntarily purchase and retire VCCs 
is for their own carbon accounting and related 
claims that may be made in service of net zero delivery. Companies should be able to use VCCs alongside internal decarbonisation efforts. 
Government recognition of the potential of the 
VCM to help achieve NDCs, and clear rules for a functioning market are critical to scale-up cor -
porate climate action. Governments are increas -
ingly developing VCM principles (e.g. Singapore and UK governments), guidelines and frame -
works to set these clear rules including the new -
ly established Coalition to Grow Carbon Mar -
kets, a multi-national effort to provide aligned principles to the global business community.
31
2.2 U SE OF VCC s IN DOMESTIC
 AND IN TERNATIONAL COMPLIANCE
 MARKETS
Besides voluntary use of VCCs by corporates, VCCs are also being used under domestic and internationally regulated frameworks.
32 Notably, 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement allows coun -
tries to use VCCs as a flexible mechanism to 
support countries in meeting their NDCs and 
Long-T erm Strategy ( Figure 2). Countries like 
Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Norway, and Switzerland are planning to use Article 6 VCCs 
to help meet their NDCs.
33 The Carbon Offset -
ting and Reduction Scheme for International 
Aviation (CORSIA) allows airlines to use VCCs 
to compensate emissions.34 THE URGENCY 
OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ACTION NOW. SCIENCE-BASED PATHWAYS THAT MAKE SENSE ON PAPER ARE IN THEMSELVES NOT ENOUGH – ACTIONS ARE CRITICAL.

IETA VCM GUIDELINES 2.010
Several national and subnational governments 
allow for the use of VCCs to compensate emissions regulated by domestic carbon pric-
ing instruments. T oday, around 28% of global 
GHG emissions are covered by a direct carbon price, and jurisdictions representing two-thirds of global GDP have adopted carbon taxes or 
emissions trading systems (ETS).
35 There are 
80 emissions trading systems and carbon taxes 
implemented globally, plus ETSs planned in Bra-
zil, India, and Türkiye.36 The use of VCCs to meet 
targets is consistent with how VCCs are being 
integrated into many regulatory carbon pricing 
mechanisms (Figure 3).
These frameworks often permit regulated en -
tities to retire a limited number of VCCs to fulfil 
part of their compliance obligations. In 2024, al -
most a quarter of global VCC retirements were 
to meet domestic compliance obligations. Some good examples include the California’s Cap-and-Trade program, allowing from 4% to 6% of 
VCCs to offset emissions, and Singapore’s use 
of eligible international VCCs to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. The French Climate and Resilience Act requiring airlines to offset 
100% of their GHG emissions from domestic 
flights.
VCCs are being used within the national ETSs 
of China and New Zealand and in the carbon tax 
systems of Mexico, Chile, Colombia, South Afri -
ca, and Switzerland.
37 It is also planned in Indian 
and Brazilian regulation to allow the domestic 
use of VCCs.
It should be noted that some jurisdictions are 
also considering regulating the use of VCCs for voluntary purposes (as opposed to use in do -
mestic carbon pricing schemes). This regulation includes consumer protection of green market -
ing claims to avoid misleading consumers, (e.g. EU Draft Green Claims Directive currently on hold
38), regulation on disclosure (e.g. California 
Bill AB 1305 (enacted) and Canada’s C59 leg -
islation that changes the competition act with 
regards to environmental claims). Governments could unlock demand if they set 
demand-side integrity frameworks, which clar -
ify: (i) the role that carbon credits can play in 
supporting corporate climate commitments, 
consistent with science-aligned pathways; (ii) the claims that carbon credit users can make; and (iii) guardrails for the use of carbon credits.
39
2.3 M ARKET CONVERGENCE
 AND IN TEGRITY
Carbon market mechanisms are becoming in -
creasingly integrated, with some VCCs used interchangeably across markets. As illustrated 
in Figure 4, market destination dictates the units’ 
eligibility based on private frameworks, sub-na-
tional, national and international regulation. The use also dictates rules such as whether authori -
sation by host countries and corresponding ad -
justments are required. 
The Paris Agreement requires emissions reduc -
tions and removals from Internationally Trans -
ferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOS) to be de-
ducted from host countries’ GHG mitigation ef -
fort, known as Corresponding Adjustment (CA). This CA is an accounting mechanism under the 
Article 6 Rulebook
40 to prevent double-counting 
of emissions reductions and removals across 
national inventories. VCCs from independent, 
government-run and UN regulated crediting 
programmes are also becoming interchange -
able, allowing VCCs to be used by both coun -
tries and corporates. 
Private and public high-quality labels and criteria 
are emerging globally to increase market integ -
rity. The roles of the Integrity Council for the Vol -
untary Carbon Market (ICVCM)41, CORSIA42, the 
Article 6 Rulebook43 and ICROA44 are critical, as 
illustrated in Figure 4. At the project level, ratings 
and insurance play a key role in assessing car -
bon projects and derisking investments.FROM CALIFORNIA

Greater market convergence would help scale 
investments in VCCs by increasing fungibility of VCCs, developing clear rules for accounting and claiming, delivering robust interconnected reg -
istries and infrastructure, promoting consistent reporting and review, increasing transparency, and promoting climate action. Several challeng -
es remain to achieving convergence, including 
more certainty on the legal nature of VCCs, car -
bon accounting issues, registry interoperability 
and data standardisation, clarity on correspond -
ing adjustments for the voluntary use of VCCs, and what companies can claim based on the 
use of VCCs. There are existing initiatives in the 
market to address some of these challenges, such as the ICVCM’s Continuous Improvement Work Program on Market Transparency, Scal-
ability and Standardization.
67
Certainty around the legal nature of VCCs un -
der private law is an important issue for juris -
dictions to resolve affecting accounting and tax reporting as well as the ability to safely transact and secure financing. Companies need legal 
certainty that a VCC can be the subject of pro -
prietary rights under private law in the relevant 
jurisdictions, to be able to account for the value 
of any VCCs as an asset under its regulatory re -
porting obligations.68
Further clarity is also required on the claims the end buyer may make in respect of the VCCs it has retired for voluntary use. This is an important 
issue for building integrity and avoiding claims of 
greenwashing.

robust and transparent claims.GREATER MARKET

IETA VCM GUIDELINES 2.012
Host countries are not required to apply CAs 
when companies retire VCCs for voluntary cli -
mate claims provided the VCCs is not counted 
towards any other countries’ NDC. A VCC can 
support a companies’ voluntary claim while al -
lowing the associated emission reduction or re -
moval to count toward the host country’s NDC.
Whilst not the focus of this paper, it should be 
noted that many companies also invest in oth -
er market-based instruments such as  environ -
mental attribute certificates (EACs),  r enewable 
energy certificates (RECs), sustainable aviation fuel certificates, and other commodity-specif -
ic or energy carrier certificates as part of their 
climate action and climate risk mitigation strat -
egies. Building convergence and integrity re -quires clear guidance on inventory accounting 
for these mitigation actions to be captured con-
sistently in company greenhouse gas  invento -
ries. Government’s guidance on data, disclosure format, and endorsement of other sources of

IETA would like to see increased levels of dis -
closure and reporting from carbon projects and 
standardise reporting. Improving global report -

IETA’s Guidelines for the high integrity use 
of VCCs to support companies’ delivery of net zero climate ambition:
1. Demonstrate support for the Paris Agreement goals
2. Quantify and publicly disclose scope 1, 2, and 3 emission profiles
3. Establish a net zero decarbonisation pathway and near-term targets
4. Use VCCs in line with the mitigation hierarchy
5. Ensure that only high-quality VCCs areused 
6. Transparently account and publicly disclose use of VCCs
7. Make robust, transparent, substantiated and credible claims

3. 1 DEM ONSTRATE SUPPORT FOR THE 
 P ARIS AGREEMENT GOALS
IETA takes the position that companies should use all reasonable means at their disposal to prevent or control activities carried out by their 
company, or associated with the activities of 
their company, from causing harm to the envi-ronment. They should also, where possible, pro-tect the global climate system. 
A first step in achieving such ambition is to mea -
sure the environmental impact of their activities 
and accurately account for direct and indirect emissions, whether such obligation is manda-
tory or not. The second step is to demonstrate 
the highest possible ambition in helping support the achievement of the Paris Agreement 1.5°C target by abating direct and indirect emissions 
using all reasonable means available. Such am -
bition should be disclosed in a public statement.IETA takes the position that all companies ought 
to voluntarily help finance projects that reduce, remove or avoid emissions, as doing so can 
make a significant contribution to the global am -
bition under the Paris Agreement. Companies 
can do this through the voluntary purchase of high-quality VCCs.
In summary, companies can demonstrate sup -
port for the Paris Agreement goals by:
I. Setting a science-based decarbonisation 
net zero pathway aligned with the IPCC 1.5°C pathway;
II. Meeting interim internal emissions reduction targets and staying on track to meet these targets over time in their net 
zero pathway;
III. Committing to counterbalance any residual 
emissions to reach and maintain net zero;
IV. Contributing as much as possible to the decarbonisation of the global economy and to addressing their historical emissions;
V. Ensuring compliance with domestic regulation, including national voluntary frameworks and national arrangements for 
the Paris Agreement, where relevant.
IETA highlights the importance of the adaptation 
and finance components of the Paris Agree -
ment. Private sector investment in LLMICs helps to finance adaptation and support the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Fi -
nance (NCQG). Companies are encouraged to measure and publicly report their contribution to 
adaptation and global climate finance.HIGH-INTEGRITY

3.2 QU ANTIFY AND PUBLICL Y DISCLOSE 
 SCOPE 1, 2, AND 3 EMI SSION PROFILES
For effective emissions management and trans -
parency in reporting, it is important that robust 
and accepted emissions accounting methods 
are used. A company ought to follow the man -
datory or recommended standard they are ad -
hering to, or it should use a widely recognised 
independent standard. 
Reference GHG accounting and disclosure 
frameworks include the GHG Reporting Proto -
col - Corporate Standard69 and the International 
Organisation for Standardization (ISO) 14064-1:2018.
70 Examples of good practice in global 
climate disclosure framework include the IFRS S2 Climate Related Disclosure
71 managed by 
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, which integrates the work of 
the of the T askforce For Climate Related Finan -
cial Disclosure (TCFD),
72 the Climate Disclosure 
Standards Board (CDSB),73 The Global Report -
ing Initiative Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 
(GRI),74 and the Transition Plan T askforce Dis -
closure Framework (TP TDF).75 
3.2. 1  QUANTIFY
Companies should quantify scope 1, 2, and 3 
GHG emissions, in line with internationally rec -
ognised standards, using established baselines 
and make data- and science-based decisions on where to prioritise emissions reductions 
efforts and set targets. All disclosure of GHG 
emissions should be made as a gross figure in tonnes of CO
2e.
Quantifying emissions in alignment with inter -
nationally recognised standards is essential for comparability, transparency, and alignment with UNFCCC reporting principles. This framing also supports consistent disclosures of voluntary re -
porting initiatives across different jurisdictions.Once measured, companies can then develop a detailed decarbonisation strategy including 
plans to influence, support, and collaborate 
within their value chain to drive down emis -
sions across their demand and/or supply side. These plans need to take into consideration that companies mostly have direct control over 
their scope 1 and 2 emissions profiles, but often 
do not have as much visibility, data, or control of scope 3 emissions. Responsibility and leverage over scope 3 varies significantly across sectors 
often requiring systemic, cross-sector solutions.
Emissions intensity disclosures can also be an effective quantification method enabling prod-uct and cross-sector comparisons between companies. While useful for tracking progress 
and guiding customer choice, carbon intensity 
measurement (e.g. emissions per unit of prod -
uct) should not lead to delays in absolute reduc-tions. Companies using intensity measurement 
should disclose the trajectory to net-zero using 
consistent indicators over time.
3.2.2  DISCLOSURE
Companies should regularly disclose their prog -
ress in meeting near term emissions reduction targets and net zero goals by following wide -
ly adopted disclosure frameworks to improve comparability and demonstrate progress to in -
vestors, or follow regulation, where it exists. 
T o improve robustness of reporting, it is gener -
ally considered best practice to seek third-party 
verification of the company’s emission profile.
76QUANTIFYING AND 
DISCLOSING SCOPE 1, 2, AND 3 EMISSIONS WITH RECOGNISED STANDARDS IS THE FOUNDATION OF CREDIBLE NET ZERO ACTION.

3.3 E STABLISH A NET ZERO  
 DE CARBONISATION PATHWAY AND
 NE AR-TERM TARGETS
Companies setting net zero targets need to 
address 1) their unabated emissions and make progress to reduce their emissions at a pace 
consistent with their net zero pathway as
 well as 
2) their residual emissions to reach and maintain 
net zero (Figure 5). Residual emissions may re-
duce over time as technology improves. Com-
panies will need to counterbalance the residual emissions that cannot be eliminated. A compa-ny is only considered to have reached net-zero 
when it has achieved its science-aligned net 
zero target and counterbalanced any residual emissions. 
Companies should set relevant and measurable 
decarbonisation pathways, setting targets to 
achieve the maximum abatement reasonably possible in the shortest timescale. Companies should strive to achieve the highest ambition 
using all reasonable means at their disposal, 
setting a science aligned pathway as the mini -
mum benchmark. While some companies can achieve net zero sooner than 2050, others will be restricted given their sectoral constraints 
and unique circumstances. Companies can find guidance on how to set tar -
gets from the many frameworks that have been 
developed in line with science-based practic -
es, such as Science-Based T argets Initiative,
77 
Transition Pathway Initiative,78 and Mission Pos -
sible Partnership.79 
3.3. 1  NET ZERO TARGETS
IETA supports companies setting targets that 
take into account scientific evidence related to 
climate change and are aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement goals. “Science-aligned” means that the whole of society should collec -
tively aim to reduce global emissions, relative to 2019 emissions, by 43% by 2030, 60% by 2035, 69% by 2040 and 84% by 2050.
80 “Net zero 
aligned” means a company’s gross emissions are on track to deliver its pathway to reach net 
zero by 2050 or sooner. 
Companies can contribute to these societal 
goals by aiming for net zero no later than 2050, 
while considering their own circumstances. De -
pending on their sector, geography and policies 
in the jurisdictions in which they operate, some companies may achieve net zero earlier than others. In particular, hard-to-abate sectors may 
have different pathways to net zero versus soci -
ety’s overall average pathway. “NET ZERO ALIGNED” 
MEANS A COMPANY’S GROSS EMISSIONS ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER ITS PATHWAY TO REACH NET ZERO BY 2050 OR SOONER. Figure 5. Corporate decarbonisation in a net zero pathway.
