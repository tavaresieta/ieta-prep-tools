About Ecosystem Marketplace
Ecosystem Marketplace (EM), a non-profit initiative of Forest Trends, is a leading global source of credible 
information on environmental finance, markets, and payments for ecosystem services. For nearly two 
decades, EM has run the world’s first and only globally recognized and standardized reporting and 
transparency platform for voluntary carbon market (VCM) credit pricing data, news, and insights.  
EM’s flagship State of the Voluntary Carbon Market  reports and other analyses on carbon credit 
market dynamics (e.g., prices, volumes, projects, corporate buyers, sellers, etc.) and carbon standard 
issuance and retirement data have become anticipated industry staples. EM also provides a publicly 
accessible data intelligence dashboard and a news platform for market coverage.  
EM data on prices, regulation, science, and other relevant issues on environmental services markets 
and climate finance have been used extensively by a range of market actors, from companies, 
journalists, and investors, to practitioners, natural resource agencies, academics, and local and 
indigenous communities.
About Forest Trends
Forest Trends Association is a 501(c)(3) organization founded in 1999. Forest Trends works to 
conserve forests and other ecosystems through the creation and wide adoption of a broad range 
of environmental finance, markets, and other payment and incentive mechanisms. Forest Trends 
does so by 1) providing transparent information on ecosystem values, finance, and markets through

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2024    1
Ecosystem Marketplace (EM) publishes our 
annual State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 
(SOVCM)  report – a series now approaching the 
two-decade mark – to provide a comprehensive 
overview of the global supply and demand 
of voluntary carbon credits. We interview 
and collect annual disclosures from market 
participants representing the majority of project 
developers and credit resellers, and combine 
this with registry data from the largest carbon 
credit standards and certifications. While SOVCM  
reports are always retrospective, capturing the 
previous full year of market activity, we also take 
a forward-looking lens to understand the most 
important developments shaping the future of 
the voluntary carbon market (VCM).
2023 was an unusual year for the market. Along 
with being the hottest year on record, it was also 
the year that the debate about the voluntary 
carbon market reached a fever pitch. Galvanized 
by widely read media coverage spotlighting 
cases of unethical or ineffective carbon projects 
and standards, public perception of carbon 
credits took a sharp turn toward the negative. 
At the same time, 2023 was the fourth year in an 
upswing in the value of the VCM, which began in 
earnest in 2020, hit a peak in 2021 when over  
$2 billion United States dollar (USD) of credits 
were traded, and continued into 2022 and 2023 
as higher average credit prices have partially 
offset declining transaction volumes. Altogether, 
49 percent of the total VCM value reported to EM 
since the beginning of the SOVCM  report series 
in 2005 was transacted between 2020 and 2023, 
and the total 2023 market value of $723 million 
USD was greater than the annual value for any 
year from 2009 to 2020.
There are a couple of key questions being 
asked about the future of the VCM. First, if 
given a cheaper alternative to reducing their 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in-house, will 
companies seize the opportunity to “buy their 
way out” of responsibility and continue with 
business as usual? 2023 gave us an answer: our 
analysis of corporate disclosures submitted to CDP ( All In on Climate , published October 2023) 
shows quite clearly that in terms of climate 
action and ambition, companies engaged in the 
VCM outperform their peers who don’t utilize 
carbon credits, rather than lagging behind 
them.
Second, carbon credit watchdogs have 
questioned whether carbon methodologies 
are accurately accounting for projects’ actual 
emissions reductions. 2023 was the year of 
repeat volleys between market observers 
alarmed by a series of papers contending that 
baselines for the majority of REDD+ projects were 
vastly overinflated, followed by equally sharp 
rebuttals detailing problems with those papers’ 
methodologies, and suggesting that the critical 
studies relied on cherry-picked negative findings 
and misrepresented results. A new consolidated 
methodology from the Verra standard addresses 
the issues raised, but is unlikely to completely end 
the controversy over methodological assumptions 
inherent in nature-based projects’ estimations of 
GHG mitigation and removal benefits.
In response to these concerns, a set of integrity 
initiatives (see Box 3 on page 19) have stepped in 
to play a market governance role and set clear, 
high standards for quality both on the supply 
and demand sides. But much of 2023 was spent 
in a kind of limbo waiting on signals from these 
initiatives–without a doubt sacrificing some short-
term market activity to the long-term project of 
integrity. Unresolved questions about how Article 
6 of the Paris Agreement will apply to voluntary 
carbon credits added further uncertainty to the 
market (see Box 2 on page 16). 
The VCM faced all of these headwinds in 2023. 
In response, the overall volume of the market 
dropped by 56 percent from 2022. REDD+ 
project developers in Asia, Latin America, 
and the Caribbean bore the brunt of this 
market contraction. Over the past year, many 
buyers have preferentially sought out credits 
representing emissions removals, not reductions 
(we dig into this distinction later in the report), 
and credits that are generated closer to home. Introduction

Prices were more supported, with the market 
average price dropping to $6.53/ton, down 11 
percent from $7.37 in 2022, but over 60 percent 
higher than average prices in 2021.
These are the headline figures, but frankly 
they’re of limited use in understanding the VCM 
today. Every credit represents a ton of carbon 
emissions removed or reduced, but beyond that, 
there is enormous differentiation in terms of 
pricing and market share, depending on credit 
type, geographic provenance, standard, vintage, 
and certification of additional benefits such as 
sustainable development or biodiversity. In other words, nuance is needed, and so is 
taking time to understand what the data are 
really telling us. That applies also to debates 
about carbon markets. We see good intentions 
on both sides of the VCM controversies. 
Difference, debate, and course-correction are 
a sign of a healthy system, not a broken one. 
We are honored to bring you the latest State of 
the Voluntary Carbon Market , and contribute 
in our own way to market integrity: through 
transparency and evidence.

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2024    3
1. In 2023, the volume and value of the 
voluntary carbon market (VCM) contracted 
for the second year in a row from its 2021 
peak, with a 56 percent year-on-year decline 
in the volume of reported transactions. 
 ●The total reported transaction value  
of the VCM was $723M USD, down  
61 percent from last year.
2. On average, buyers paid $6.53 per ton CO2e 
for carbon credits in 2023, a slight decrease 
from 2022. Average credit prices in 2023 were 
higher than in any year before 2022. As of 
early 2024, prices appear to be rebounding 
from this dip.
3. Market participants reported a clear negative 
impact from media scrutiny of the VCM. 
Negative press questioning the additionality 
and governance of carbon credit projects 
and potential corporate buyer greenwashing 
overshadowed many positive market 
developments in 2023. This translated to both 
a direct pullback in buyer investment, and 
increased complexity for project developers, 
whether due to changing requirements from 
credit issuing standards or greater demand for 
due diligence from credit buyers.
4. The publication of the ICVCM’s Core Carbon 
Principles and the launch of VCMI’s Claims 
Code contributed to buyer confidence in 
market quality and integrity. But delays in 
implementation of these initiatives and a lack 
of guidance from the Science Based Targets 
Initiative (SBTi) on the use of carbon offsets 
to meet corporate net-zero goals was cited by 
many respondents as a prime factor keeping 
buyers on the sidelines for much of late 2023. 
5. The data suggest a growing bifurcation 
in the market between buyers seeking 
pure carbon removal projects and those 
committed to projects that deliver social and 
environmental co-benefits. Co-benefits are 
a core motive for some buyers, an interesting 
trend pointing to the possibility of greater convergence with emerging markets for 
nature-positive and biodiversity credits.
 ●In 2023, buyers preferentially sought out 
credits representing emissions removals 
and clearly demonstrated project 
additionality .
 ●While the share of credits traded from 
projects certifying “beyond carbon” 
co-benefits through Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) or individual 
certifications grew, the premium that 
buyers paid for these credits declined from 
2022 values, suggesting a growing supply 
of projects providing local co-benefits.
6. Although total market value fell for all 
VCM credit categories, different categories 
had distinct trajectories in terms of traded 
volumes and average price. 
 ●The biggest gross declines in volume 
occurred among Forestry and Land Use 
and Renewable Energy credits, which 
remain the most popular project types, 
but faced intense scrutiny, particularly 
around project additionality calculations. 
 ●The volume of transactions in the Energy 
Efficiency/Fuel Switching, Agriculture, and 
Household/Community Devices categories 
all increased  from 2022.
 ●Within the Forestry and Land Use credit 
category, REDD+ credits, the most 
popular nature-based project type, lost 
62 percent of their value year-over-
year, with transaction volume falling 
51 percent and price falling 23 percent. 
Prices for Afforestation-Reforestation and 
Revegetation (ARR) and Improved Forest 
Management (IFM) credits both increased. 
The 2023 pullback from REDD+ projects 
affected transaction volume of projects 
in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, 
where the majority of these projects are 
located. EM survey respondents shared 
that many buyers in higher income 
countries are seeking credits from projects 
closer to home.Key Findings

Total Volume, Value, and Price 
In 2023, the volume and value of the voluntary 
carbon market (VCM) contracted to a total of 
111 million tons CO2e (MtCO2e) transacted - a 56 
percent drop from 2022 levels (Figure 2; Table 
1). Credit prices also fell, but by less. The average 
price per ton CO2e of VCM credits declined by  
11 percent from record highs in 2022, to $6.53 USD 
per ton CO2e in 2023. Early data on 2024 prices 
to date suggest they are holding at or above this 
level. The combination of a decrease in volume 
and a pullback from last year’s peak prices 
translated to a 61 percent decline in total market 
value year-over-year, for a total reported value of 
$723 million USD (Figure 1; Table 1).These figures are based on market data received 
from 90 EM Respondents with transactions in 
2023, compared to 115 Respondents in 2022. The 
number of Respondents declined year-over-year 
due to mergers between some Respondents 
and others temporarily pausing credit sales in 
2023 while they waited for the VCM to establish 
stronger integrity and quality norms. It is not 
surprising that fewer Respondents shared 
transaction data in a year of lower volume. 
EM analysts confirmed that this effect did not 
skew the estimate of the decline in transaction 
volume from 2022 by comparing a core group of 
80 Respondents who submitted data for both 
2022 and 2023, including the highest-volume 
Respondents. The relative decline in transaction Market Overview

volume for this group was 54 percent from 
2022, indicating that the finding of a 56 percent 
decline in the total VCM volume in 2023 is robust. 
Qualitative feedback from EM Respondents 
indicated disparate trends among sub-sectors of 
the market that help explain why credit volumes 
dropped so steeply, while value declined 
relatively less. Market participants expressed 
increasing buyer preference for credits from 
nature-based and community-focused project 
types that offer environmental and social co-
benefits in addition to emissions reductions, 
as opposed to credits generated by carbon 
removal, most frequently through Afforestation-
Reforestation and Revegetation (ARR) projects.
Carbon Credit Price, by Buyer Type
In 2023, VCM credit sales to end users1 had 
a 33 percent price premium over sales to 
intermediaries, consistent with 2022 (Table 2). 
Intermediaries who take ownership of credits for 
speculative purposes are typically more price-
sensitive, though the magnitude of this effect 
varies by project category and carbon credit 
standard. 
1 “End users” include transactions where the buyer was 
identified as an end user as well as those where the buyer 
was an intermediary who does not take delivery of credits, 
but instead purchases on behalf of an end user.Energy Efficiency/Fuel Switching and Renewable 
Energy credit transactions had the largest 
premium for end users, and the majority of sales 
in these categories were to intermediaries. This 
suggests that buyers in these sectors rely more 
on intermediary brokers and resellers to parse 
project quality, and that credit resellers can 
take advantage of the relatively low prices of 
credits from Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy projects to make a greater profit when 
selling to end users. The majority of transactions 
in the Chemical Processes and Industrial 
Manufacturing, Forestry and Land Use, and 
Agriculture categories were sales to end users, 
and premiums for these end-user sales were 
smaller than for other categories because these 
credits changed hands fewer times.

Gold Standard credits had the greatest premium 
for end-user sales among credit standards, 
amounting to a 140 percent premium in 2023, up 
from 83 percent in 2022. The premium for end-
user sales of Clean Development Mechanism 
(CDM) and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) 
credits also increased substantially, with a 
premium of 58 percent for CDM in 2023 versus 
18 percent in 2022. End users paid a 47 percent 
premium for VCS credits in 2023 versus 30 
percent in 2022. This may indicate that credit 
buyers are increasingly turning to trusted 
intermediaries to vet project quality for the 
largest carbon credit standards. Credit resellers 
played a large role in CDM credit transactions, 
in particular, with the proportion of CDM credit 
sales to intermediaries increasing to 73 percent 
in 2023, versus 54 percent in 2022. This growth 
in credits sold to intermediaries and the gradual 
decline in CDM credit issuances now that CDM 
is no longer registering new projects is likely 
the result of market uncertainty around the 
transition of CDM projects to a future Article 6 
mechanism for transnational carbon trading 
under the Paris Agreement.Registry Data – Project Registrations, 
Issuances, and Retirements
EM analysis of publicly available data from 
credit standard registries of projects and 
credit issuances and retirements illuminates 
the underlying supply and demand of carbon 
credits underpinning VCM transactions. Despite 
market headwinds, the total number of new 
registered projects grew to 694 in 2023, led by 
329 Household/Community Devices projects. 
Forestry and Land Use, Renewable Energy, 
Agriculture, and Waste Disposal project 
registrations also grew year-on-year, while the 
greatest decline in new registrations was for 
Chemical Processes/Industrial Manufacturing 
(Figure 3).
New project registrations represent the end of a 
long process involving a project proposal, public 
comment period, and methodological validation. 
Credit issuances by projects often occur close 
to the time of initial credit sale by the project 
developer, while end users may wait one or

more years to retire credits that they purchase 
from the VCM. Therefore, recent market trends 
reflect the rate of registrations, issuances, and 
retirements, in combination with the volume 
of transactions that do not result in credit 
retirement.
Compared to 2022, there was a 93 MtCO2e 
decrease in credit issuances in 2023 and a 2.6 
MtCO2e increase in retirements, indicating 
that the surplus supply of carbon credits is 
tightening, but still substantial (Figure 4). The 
categories contributing the most to the decline 
in issuances were Chemical Processes/Industrial 
Manufacturing and Energy Efficiency/Fuel 
Switching. Meanwhile, issuances of Household/
Community Devices and Transportation credits 
increased, with Household/Community Devices 
projects more than doubling the volume of 
credits issued in 2022 with an increase of 31 
MtCO2e (Figure 5). Issuances of Transportation 
credits increased in 2023, which is a natural 
result of an increase in Transportation projects registered in 2022; the annual transaction 
volume for this category remains low.
The categories with the greatest growth in 
retirements were Forestry and Land Use and 
Chemical Processes/Industrial Manufacturing, 
while retirements of Renewable Energy, Waste 
Disposal, and Transportation credits decreased 
(Figure 5). This suggests that credit buyers 
are moving away from projects with weaker 
additionality, such as international clean 
infrastructure financing, and embracing projects 
that deliver clear carbon removals and emissions 
reductions in the Forestry and Land Use and 
Chemical Processes/Industrial Manufacturing 
categories. Total annual credit retirements have 
hovered around 170 MtCO2e for the past three 
years, indicating that the fundamental demand 
from end users has remained steady, with more 
upside for the rate of retirements if corporate 
buyers are permitted to claim credits as offsets 
against their Scope 3 emissions targets (see Box 
3, page 19).

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2024    9
The reduction or removal of one ton of carbon emissions is equivalent no matter where in the 
world it takes place, which is the basis of carbon credits as a fungible instrument to finance 
climate change mitigation. Depending on the circumstances of the credit’s generation, or the 
circumstances of its use as an offset for greenhouse gas emissions, a transaction can be considered 
part of the VCM or a compliance carbon market, or–due to increasing linkages between the VCM 
and compliance carbon markets–a part of both market types.
Voluntary and compliance carbon markets can be differentiated based on the source of supply 
for carbon credits or the ultimate type of demand for emissions offsetting. Credits may be 
issued through one of three processes: international crediting mechanisms administered by 
an international organization (e.g., the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), national or sub-
national governmental crediting mechanisms (e.g., the California Compliance Offset Program, the 
Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme, or the Japanese J-Credit Scheme), or independent crediting 
mechanisms (e.g., Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and Gold Standard).
Carbon credits can be used as emissions offsets within international or domestic compliance 
mechanisms or for voluntary purposes. As established in the Paris Agreement, credits traded for 
international compliance purposes can contribute to the buyer country’s Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs), and must include a “corresponding adjustment,” which is an additional 
agreement that prevents the project’s host country from “double-counting” the traded emissions 
reductions/removals against their own NDCs (see Box 2, Implementation of Article 6 of the 
Paris Agreement). Domestic compliance schemes are established within a country, subnational 
jurisdiction, or an industry (e.g., automobile manufacturing), and often include a credit issuance 
mechanism to facilitate emissions reduction trading. Finally, there is the voluntary segment of 
demand, which consists of private entities such as corporations purchasing and retiring carbon 
credits to meet their own self-imposed emissions reduction goals.
The boundaries between the VCM and international and domestic compliance markets have 
become blurred as compliance systems, such as the California Cap-and-Trade Program and 
the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), have allowed 
participants to use credits from independent crediting mechanisms that would otherwise be 
considered voluntary credits. International mechanisms, the most prominent example being CDM, 
are meant to drive investment in climate solutions in countries with the greatest potential for 
greenhouse gas mitigation. However, because participation in these systems by project proponents 
and credit buyers is entirely voluntary, they can also be considered voluntary mechanisms, even 
when used to achieve internationally mandated outcomes.
EM believes that our Respondents, who are typically sell-side market participants, are best-placed 
to determine whether their credit transactions were within the voluntary or compliance carbon 
markets. The VCM transactions discussed in this report originate from independent crediting 
mechanisms as well as the international, UN-administered CDM .Box 1: Connections Between Voluntary and Compliance Carbon Credit Markets
