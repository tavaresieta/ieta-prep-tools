Project Category and Type
Although total market value fell for all categories 
of VCM credits, the causes of this decline in 
value varied between categories. Volume and/
or average transaction price increased in some 
categories (Table 3). The Energy Efficiency/
Fuel Switching, Agriculture, and Household/
Community Devices categories all grew in 
volume, up 43 percent, 24 percent, and 10 
percent, respectively. Forestry and Land Use and 
Renewable Energy credits had the largest gross 
declines in volume, though they remain the 
most popular project types. 
Respondents cited delays in issuing new Forestry 
and Land Use credits related to two major factors 
last year: 1) waiting for Verra to release their 
updated consolidated methodology for Reduced 
Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation 
in Developing Countries (REDD+) projects, and 
2) increased buyer due diligence in the face of 
recent media scrutiny of these projects. The decline in Renewable Energy credit 
transaction volume may be a natural 
consequence of a decline in the supply of these 
credits. Issuances in this category have trailed 
off following a peak in new Renewable Energy 
projects registered in 2020.
Within the Forestry and Land Use category, 
REDD+ credit prices fell 23 percent, but REDD+ 
remained the most popular project type 
within the category. Prices for ARR credits 
rose 31 percent and prices for Improved Forest 
Management (IFM) rose 11 percent, even though 
these credits make up a smaller share of the 
Forestry and Land Use category in 2023 by 
volume. This trend supports qualitative data 
from Respondents indicating more interest 
and investment in project types that generate 
nature-based carbon removal credits. The 
volume of Blue Carbon credit transactions 
reported to EM fell by 88 percent from 2022. In 
2023, a much larger proportion of Blue Carbon 
credits traded were less expensive credits from Volume, Value, and Price, by Project 
Attributes

Wetland Restoration/Management projects 
without associated Afforestation, Reforestation, 
and Revegetation (ARR) activities, driving prices 
down for this cluster of project types (Table 4).
Waste Disposal credit volume fell 77 percent, 
but average credit price for this category 
increased slightly. The largest decreases in price 
were in the Agriculture, Energy Efficiency/Fuel 
Switching, and Chemical Processes/Industrial 
Manufacturing categories, where price fell by 41 
percent, 32 percent, and 20 percent, respectively. 
The increasing volume and decreasing price 
for Energy Efficiency/Fuel Switching and 
Agriculture credits suggests that new sources 
of credits have come into these segments of the 
markets. The decline in the price of Chemical 
Processes/Industrial Manufacturing credits can 
be attributed to a large increase in the volume 
of North American industrial process efficiency 
credit transactions reported to EM in 2023 priced 
at less than $5 per ton of CO2e.
Details of Project Categories
The Agriculture category includes project types 
focused on the sustainable management of 
farmland and pasture, including soil carbon 
sequestration through sustainable farmland or 
pasture management, livestock waste methane 
management, conservation of grassland habitats, and avoidance of methane production 
in rice cultivation. The volume of Agriculture 
credit transactions reported to EM continued 
to grow in 2023, marking a fourth consecutive 
year of growth since 2019. Although respondents 
reported trading credits issued by seven different 
standards, credits from VCS projects made 
up the largest proportion by far, representing 
95 percent of total traded volume. Projects in 
Asia contributed 42 percent of the volume of 
Agriculture credits traded in 2023, followed 
by Latin America and the Caribbean, which 
contributed 38 percent.
Chemical Processes/Industrial Manufacturing 
is the category with the third largest volume 
of transactions in 2023. These projects focus 
on eliminating greenhouse gas production 
or reducing the volume of greenhouse gases 
used in industrial applications. Representative 
project types in 2023 include nitrous oxide 
destruction in chemical production; reclamation 
and replacement of hydrofluorocarbons in 
applications, including refrigerants and foam 
production; fugitive emissions capture and 
destruction, including methane from coal mines; 
and other industrial process emissions reduction 
activities. Respondents reported trading credits 
from the American Carbon Registry (ACR) in 
47 percent of transactions in 2023, followed Table 4. VCM Transaction Volumes, Values, and Prices, by Forestry and Land Use Project Types, 2022-2023

by Climate Action Reserve (CAR), which made 
up 18 percent of transactions, and VCS, at 8 
percent. North America grew to become the 
largest source for Chemical Processes/Industrial 
Manufacturing credits traded in 2023, making 
up 66 percent of transaction volume in this 
category. Asia was a distant second, at 8 percent.
Projects in the Energy Efficiency/Fuel Switching 
category reduce consumption of fossil fuels by 
increasing the efficiency of industrial processes 
and residential and commercial heating and 
lighting and by switching power and heat 
generation from fossil fuels to biomass or less 
carbon-intensive fuels, such as natural gas. This 
category grew the most in 2023, with transaction 
volume up 43 percent from 2022, mostly driven 
by an increase in the volume of industrial energy 
efficiency credits. The largest share of credits 
traded originated from projects in North America 
(39 percent), followed by Asia (17 percent). The 
most prevalent standard was ACR (39 percent), 
followed by VCS (23 percent).
Forestry and Land Use remains the largest 
category of carbon credits by transaction 
volume, despite 2023 volumes declining 66 
percent from 2022. REDD+ project types made 
up the majority of credits traded in this category 
(78 percent), while ARR and IFM credits made 
up 11 percent and 7 percent, respectively. 
Credits from projects in Latin America and the 
Caribbean constituted 36 percent of transaction 
volume for Forestry and Land Use, followed by 
Africa (25 percent) and Asia (18 percent). This 
category saw credits traded from the greatest number of countries in 2023. While VCS remains 
the most popular standard for Forestry and Land 
Use credits at 85 percent of total transacted 
volume, this category included the greatest 
variety of standards for traded credits.
This category includes all projects that focus on 
reducing carbon emissions at the household 
or community level, rather than through land-
use practices or large-scale industrial processes. 
Popular project types in this category include 
efficient cookstove and water purification device 
distribution, which mitigate greenhouse gas 
emissions caused by deforestation for fuel 
in rural areas; community energy efficiency 
projects; and biogas infrastructure for fossil-fuel 
free heating and cooking in rural communities. 
The volume of Household/Community Devices 
credits traded grew 10 percent from 2022, with 
an increase in transactions of clean cookstove 
credits responsible for almost all of this growth. 
The majority of Household/Community Devices 
projects took place in Africa (56 percent), 
followed by Asia (14 percent). Fifty-five percent 
of the volume of credits traded in this category 
in 2023 were from a Gold Standard project, 
followed by 40 percent from VCS projects.
Renewable Energy projects were the second-
largest category by transaction volume. 
These projects mitigate carbon emissions 
by using renewable energy to displace fossil 
fuel consumption. Project types include 
electricity and heat generation using wind, 
solar, hydropower, geothermal energy, biogas 
from the decomposition of organic waste, and 
renewable biomass. Renewable Energy credits ENERGY EFFICIENCY/

were traded from the widest variety of projects 
in 2023. Of those credits, 37 percent of the traded 
volume came from projects in Asia, followed by 
11 percent from projects in Latin America and the 
Caribbean. VCS was the largest source for credits 
in this category, at 45 percent of transaction 
volume, followed by Gold Standard (33 percent) 
and CDM (20 percent).
Transportation projects reduce emissions by 
increasing the efficiency of transportation sys-
tems, including by developing new systems, such 
as mass transit and electric vehicles. EM received 
trade data from Transportation projects from 
fewer than three Respondents in 2023, so EM 
cannot share category-specific information about 
transaction volume and average credit prices.
Waste Disposal projects reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions by capturing and destroying 
methane from decaying organic material (except 
when this methane is used to generate heat or 
electricity; these project types are included in 
the Renewable Energy category), recycling old 
materials to avoid emissions associated with 
new manufacturing, and composting organic 
waste to prevent methane production. While the 
volume of Waste Disposal transactions fell from 2022, prices held steady year-on-year, unlike all 
other project categories, which may indicate 
an ongoing shift towards higher-quality Waste 
Disposal project methodologies. North America 
was host to the greatest share of projects with 
credits traded in 2023 (28 percent), followed by 
Latin America and the Caribbean (13 percent).
Nature-based and Engineered Credits
There was a notable reduction in transactions 
from nature-based credit projects in the VCM in 
2023, with the proportion of nature-based credits 
falling from 46 percent in 2022 to 37 percent of 
credit transactions (this includes all transactions 
in the Agriculture and Forestry and Land Use 
categories). The price of nature-based credits 
also fell by 65 percent, leading to an overall 68 
percent decline in the value of the nature-based 
segment of the VCM (Table 5). Despite the 
relative decrease in the value of these credits, 
nature-based credits still held a 91 percent 
price premium over credits from engineered 
project types (down slightly from a 107 percent 
premium in 2022). The reduced demand is likely 
due to a decrease in the liquidity of credits from 
nature-based projects in the wake of prominent 
criticism of the VCM, especially REDD+ project 
baseline calculations, which establish the 
number of credits available for developers to sell 
based on the emissions reductions and carbon 
removals achieved by each project. 
Following a series of high-profile media coverage 
questioning the accuracy of estimated emissions 
reductions from REDD+ methodologies, 
there has been an overall shift away from 
nature-based projects towards credits from 
engineered methodologies, where the quantity 
of greenhouse gas reductions is more easily 
calculated. Verra, the organization responsible 
for maintaining the VCS standard that hosts TRANSPORTATION

the majority of REDD+ projects, released a new 
version of their consolidated REDD+ methodology 
in November 2023 that includes updated 
baseline calculations and uncertainty estimation 
procedures. Though the updated methodology 
arrived too late in the year to make a discernable 
impact on the volume of transactions in 2023, this 
development is expected to influence sales of 
REDD+ credits in 2024.
Reductions and Removals
Carbon credits can either represent 1) emissions 
reductions or 2) removals of carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere. Reductions are achieved 
through energy efficiency, the substitution of 
renewable energy for fossil fuels, or avoided 
degradation or destruction of natural carbon 
sinks such as forests. Removals are generated 
through nature-based methodologies, including 
ARR, or engineered solutions, including direct air 
capture and biochar production. 
In 2023, VCM buyers continued to place a 
premium on carbon credits from projects that 
generate removals over projects that only 
generate reductions. In 2023, the price premium 
for trades of removal credits versus reduction 
credits was 245 percent, which is up from an 
already impressive 152 percent premium in 
2022. This indicates how much more buyers 
value removal credits over credits that represent 
emissions reductions only. While the volume 
of both reduction and removal credits declined 
in 2023 along with the overall volume of VCM 
transactions, the share of credits traded from 
carbon removal projects and projects that both 
remove carbon and reduce emissions grew from 
31 percent in 2022 to 36 percent in 2023 (see 
“Removals” and “Both” in Table 6). The average price of removal-specific credits 
increased 32 percent, but the average price 
of credits from projects that included both 
reductions and removals decreased 21 
percent (these credits come from REDD+, 
IFM, regenerative agriculture projects, and 
other nature-based project types focused on 
landscape-scale carbon management). This 
decline in combined reduction and removal 
credit price can largely be attributed to the 
market’s pullback from REDD+ projects following 
heavy criticism.
Project Standard
Transaction data reported to EM for 2023 showed 
some changes in market share by credit issuing 
standard (Table 7). VCS remained the largest 
standard by volume, while transaction volumes 
for VCS credits fell 64 percent year-over-year 
in the face of consistent media scrutiny. The 
volume of CDM credits also fell sharply by 82 
percent from 2022 to 2023. With the decline 
in CDM credit volume, Gold Standard became 
the second-largest standard by reported 
transaction volume. American Carbon Registry 
(ACR) transaction volume increased 206 percent, 
ultimately making up nearly 10 percent of the 
total 2023 VCM transaction volume. 
Average prices fell for credits from most 
standards in 2023, except the average price of 
CAR credits, CDM credits, and UK Woodland 
Carbon Code credits, which increased 63 percent, 
36 percent, and 20 percent, respectively. The 
concurrent increase in ACR transaction volume 
and decline in price is due to a large increase in 
Chemical Processes/Industrial Manufacturing 
and Energy Efficiency/Fuel Switching credits 
sold from that standard (as opposed to mostly

Forestry and Land Use credits in 2022). For 
CDM, the decline in volume can be attributed 
to dwindling supply and uncertainty about the 
future of CDM project issuances given a pending 
transition to an Article 6-based transnational 
trading scheme. The increase in price and 
growth in the share of CDM project credit sales to 
intermediaries suggests that credit resellers are 
hunting for credits from the most high-quality 
CDM projects to market to end users.
Project Location
Reported transaction volumes declined for 
credits from all regions in 2023, except North 
America, where volume increased by 15 percent. 
The largest decline in volume occurred in Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, driven by a 
pullback from REDD+ projects, the majority of 
which are located in these regions. 
Credit price fell the most in North America, due 
to a large influx of inexpensive industrial process 
emissions reduction credits. In other regions 
of the Global North, prices rose dramatically; in 
Oceania, the average credit price jumped 153 
percent from 2022, and in Europe, average prices 
increased 78 percent. Some EM Respondents 
shared that many buyers in higher income 
countries are increasingly seeking credits from 
projects based in their home country or region. 
The average price of credits in Latin America  
and the Caribbean was largely unchanged (up  
2 percent year-over-year).Table 7 . VCM Transaction Volumes, Values, and Prices, by Project Standard, 2022-2023

16                                                           On the Path to Maturity
The Paris Agreement entered into force in 2016, but key provisions have not yet taken effect because 
international stakeholders are still negotiating certain implementation details. The outstanding 
key provision most relevant to the VCM is Article 6, which establishes a framework for international 
cooperation in achieving Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) through market and non-
market mechanisms. At COP26 in 2021, country negotiators established three sub-articles to Article 6: 
 ●Article 6.2,  which permits two or more countries to cooperate to trade Article 6 units directly; 
 ●Article 6.4,  which allows for the creation of a Supervisory Body to succeed the Clean 
Development Mechanism (CDM), approve methodologies, and maintain a registry of projects for 
an international credit trading mechanism; and 
 ●Article 6.8,  which refers to non-market mechanisms and is therefore less relevant to the VCM. 
In the two years since 2021, parties to the Paris Agreement have continued to establish reporting 
rules and governing bodies for Article 6, but have yet to fully operationalize the mechanisms defined 
by the sub-articles.
The major difference between credit trading under Article 6.2 and Article 6.4 is that the former 
governs direct trading of credits between governments, and the latter involves trading through a 
centralized mechanism similar to the legacy CDM system. National representatives did not come to a 
full agreement on all details of Article 6 implementation during COP28 in 2023. However, some Article 
6.2 activities are moving forward as governments trade mitigation outcomes directly with one another 
in exchange for financial support, capacity building, or technology transfers. While several Article 6.2 
pilot projects are underway, and one transfer of mitigation outcomes was completed in early 2024, the 
lack of normative procedures for trading mitigation outcomes has created a situation in which every 
Article 6.2 transaction brings reputational risk to host and buyer countries. 
In host countries, governments must determine how to create national frameworks for carbon 
market activities, including which project types are allowed in Article 6 trading and considerations 
for how trading might affect their own NDCs. Host countries are also responsible for tracking the 
provenance of credits as part of Article 6.2 by including a “corresponding adjustment,” which is an 
additional agreement that prevents host countries from “double-counting” traded credits against 
their own NDCs. Buyer countries are also exploring different strategies to implement Article 6.2, with 
some allowing a market-based approach, where individual businesses must purchase credits to 
meet national emissions reduction targets, while others opt for a centralized approach, where the 
government takes the lead in acquiring carbon credits to meet the country’s NDCs.
Implementation of Article 6.4, on the other hand, has been completely stalled until parties to the 
Paris Agreement can agree on the provisions of the international mechanism that will replace the 
CDM. Until this is decided, hundreds of CDM projects remain in limbo, unable to issue new vintages of 
credits. Determining which methodologies will be included in the successor mechanism is the main 
issue to be resolved with Article 6.4. The CDM was at the vanguard of the development of carbon 
mar kets, but many CDM methodologies have been criticized for a lack of additionality, particularly 
renewable energy projects in low- and middle-income countries that may have occurred regardless 
of finance from carbon credits. Parties negotiating rules for Article 6.4 will also have to consider the 
role of nature-based credits, as the CDM only allowed methodologies for Afforestation-Reforestation 
and Revegetation (ARR) projects, which excluded more recently developed project types that have 
become prominent, such as Improved Forest Management (IFM), REDD+, and agricultural soil carbon 
sequestration projects.
For more information on the latest developments on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, see The Nature 
Conservancy’s Article 6 Explainer , which covers the ongoing negotiations in more depth.

Co-benefit and Sustainable  
Development Goals Certifications
EM Respondents and VCM market actors 
consistently shared that the market oriented more 
towards carbon credits that were perceived as 
coming from higher-quality projects in 2023. One 
way that projects can be judged as higher quality is 
by demonstrating “beyond carbon” environmental 
and social co-benefits, such as preserving and 
restoring biodiversity, contributing to water 
security, or supporting sustainable local economies. 
Carbon credit projects can establish the existence 
of co-benefits through certifications including 
Verra’s Climate, Community, and Biodiversity and  
sustainable development-focused SD VISta  prog - 
rams and the independent Social Carbon Standard.2  
Projects may also be certified as providing co-  
benefits related to the 17 UN Sustainable Develop -
ment Goals (SDGs), which link global develop -
ment and prosperity with improved health and 
education, reduced inequality, and resilient natural 
ecosystems. Some equity-focused standards expect 
projects to demonstrate that they accomplish 
several SDGs. Gold Standard, for example, requires 
projects to contribute to at least three SDGs 
(including SDG 13-Climate Action) and Plan Vivo

dard in 2022, this analysis focuses on projects that were cer -
tified by Social Carbon during the period when it acted as a 
separate co-benefit certification body that reviewed projects 
developed under other registries’ methodologies.requires that all approved projects contribute to at 
least six SDGs (including SDG 1-Poverty Alleviation, 
and SDG 8-Decent Work and Economic Growth).
In 2023, the share of VCM transactions from 
projects with co-benefit certifications grew to 
28 percent, up from 22 percent in 2022 (Table 9). 
The share of transactions from projects with one 
or more SDG certification grew to 26 percent in 
2023, compared to 18 percent in 2022 (Table 10). 
While the share of credits with co-benefits traded 
increased, the price of credits with co-benefit and 
SDG certifications fell more than the VCM as a 
whole, with the average price of credits with co-
benefits declining by 23 percent and the average 
price of credits with SDGs dropping 31 percent. As 
a result, while credits with associated co-benefits 
still fetch a price premium, that premium fell to 
37 percent in 2023, down from 63 percent in 2022. 
The premium for credits with associated SDGs also 
fell to 34 percent in 2023, compared to 79 percent 
in 2022. This decline in price relative to credits 
without co-benefits or SDGs appears to be due to 
an increased supply of credits from projects with 
co-benefits in 2023. In particular, the growth in 
transactions from Cookstove Distribution projects 
in the Household/Community Devices category is 
a key factor driving co-benefit premiums down.
Credit Vintage
Carbon credits are issued with a specific 
“vintage,” representing the year in which verified 
emissions reduction activities took place. Due Quality Indicators Affecting Volume,

18                                                           On the Path to Maturity
to multi-stage validation and verification 
processes, credit standards may allow projects 
to issue all credits from a given vintage at once 
or may require a gradual release to satisfy buffer 
requirements that account for the risk of reversal 
for the carbon removal or reduction. As project 
methodologies continue to evolve in response to 
expert critique and market scrutiny, buyers have 
come to show a preference for credits from more 
recent vintages, which may reduce the risk that 
they buy credits from a project that will have its 
additionality called into question in the future.
In 2023, there was very little change in the price 
premium for credits from the last five years over 
older credits. The premium was 50 percent, 
down slightly from 54 percent in 2022 (Table 11). 
As project methodologies continue to mature, 
this recency premium may continue to decline if buyers be come more confident in the supply of 
high-quality credits from more than five years ago. 
Conversely, if VCM demand (as measured by the 
rate of credit retirements) continues to grow, the 
remaining supply of acceptable older credits may 
dwindle to zero, contributing to an overall increase 
in VCM prices. EM Respondents stated that buyers 
continue to have a strong preference for newer 
credit vintages, although delays in credit issuances 
due to registry project validation and verification 
processes can affect the supply of credits from the 
very latest vintage.
CORSIA Eligibility
The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme 
for International Aviation (CORSIA) has been an 
important driver of demand during its 2021-2023 
pilot phase. During this phase, airlines have been 
able to voluntarily buy eligible carbon credits from 
certain standards and project types to offset their 
carbon emissions from international flights. In 
the beginning of this period, especially before the 
introduction of the ICVCM Core Carbon Prin ciples, 
CORSIA was partially seen as a de facto qua lity 
standard for the VCM. In the pilot phase, credits 
from 11 different standards were eligible for CORSIA, 
but most forestry projects from these stan dards 
were excluded, due to a higher risk of reversal. Table 11. Y ear-over-year Comparison of VCM Tran  sac-

Note: For the purposes of this analysis, CORSIA eligibility is defined at the project level. If credits from any vintage of a project 
are considered CORSIA-eligible, then the entire project is counted as CORSIA-eligible. CORSIA-eligibility is assessed only for 
transactions that are reported to EM with a corresponding Project ID that can be matched to the carbon credit standard 
registry where that project is registered, and the CORSIA tag can be derived directly from the registry data.

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2024    19
In 2022, Respondents reported a 30 percent 
premium for transactions of CORSIA-eligible 
credits to EM, but that premium no longer existed 
in 2023  (Table 12). The first implementation phase 
of CORSIA  will begin in 2024, and as of this writing, only two  project standards have been approved 
for offsetting. It remains to be seen which 
standards will be included in this phase of CORSIA 
and how project requirements may change from 
the pilot phase.
Both the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary 
Carbon Market (ICVCM) launched key frameworks on carbon market integrity in the second half of 
2023, each focusing on integrity in different parts of the carbon credit lifecycle. 
ICVCM’s Core Carbon Principles (CCPs)  set a global standard and benchmark for high-integrity carbon 
projects. The CCPs are made up of ten fundamental, science-based principles for identifying high-
quality carbon credits. Each CCP represents verifiable climate impact based on principles of good 
governance, transparency, additionality, sustainable development benefits, and five other principles. 
Using an Assessment Framework , the CCPs define high-quality and high-integrity credits for the 
issuing standard and standard-specific methodologies, guide projects and standards towards integrity, 
and provide information to buyers to inform their search for high-quality credits.
The VCMI Claims Code of Practice  is demand-side guidance to help companies credibly use VCM 
credits as part of their net-zero decarbonization targets. Companies can make a “Carbon Integrity” 
claim, which is a climate achievement claim verified using VCMI’s Monitoring, Reporting, and Assurance 
(MRA) Framework. The process of certifying a Carbon Integrity claim requires companies to disclose 
information on their corporate climate action practices including adherence to best practices, and 
key data on the carbon credits they are using to make their claims. All information disclosed must be 
verified by a third-party. 
ICVCM and VCMI did not have a clear impact on the market in 2023 because their frameworks were not 
operationalized until mid- to late-2023. However, these initiatives began to gain traction in early 2024: 
ICVCM approved five standards as CCP-eligible, and Bain & Company made a VCMI Carbon Integrity 
Platinum Claim, which means they demonstrated progress on internal decarbonization and went 
above and beyond for their investment in high-integrity carbon credits.
It is also important to consider the potential role of the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) for 
corporate buyers of carbon credits. SBTi’s widely adopted net-zero standard  helps corporations identify 
and set realistic, but ambitious, time-bound emissions reduction targets to achieve net-zero. To date, 
SBTi has not allowed the use of VCM credits to count against net-zero targets, but as of the writing 
of this report in mid-2024, the SBTi board has released a statement to say that they are considering a 
change of policy for use of credits in Scope 3 abatement. To date, SBTi is working with 8,511 companies  
to set science-based targets and 5,307 of those companies already have an approved target. If SBTi 
were to approve the use of VCM credits to offset some Scope 3 emissions, it could drive a major increase 
in the demand for VCM credits, given the high volume of emissions typically associated with Scope 3.
In addition to integrity initiatives, private carbon credit rating agencies like Sylvera, Calyx, and 
BeZero offer buyers information about the quality of carbon credit projects to help them make good 
purchasing decisions and ensure their claims are credible. These independent, third-party assessments 
of carbon project impacts have offered buyers some guidance on credit quality while they awaited 
guidance from integrity initiatives. However, the unregulated nature of these agencies led to some 
criticism and confusion, due to the various proprietary methodologies used to assess emissions 
reductions or removals, community safeguards, and other aspects of project quality. This has resulted in 
different agencies generating different ratings for the same project types. Rating project types is also a 
limited assessment, given the wide diversity of project activities within types.Box 3: The Impact of Integrity Initiatives and Ratings Agencies on Carbon Credit Sales

EM surveyed 46 high-volume Respondents 
to collect their qualitative sentiments on 
the VCM in 2023. Respondents’ views on the 
overall market trajectory illustrate how uneven 
performance in individual sectors of the VCM 
was in 2023. Seventeen Respondents said their 
sales volume decreased, 11 said it remained 
about the same, and 15 stated that their volume 
increased from 2022. Average sales price 
increased for 18 Respondents, remained about 
the same for 11, and decreased for 14 (Figure 6).
Respondents were vocal about the impact of 
media publications critical of the VCM, with 
20 rating media as one of the most important 
factors influencing credit sales in 2023. However, 
company climate targets were seen as a slightly 
more relevant factor, with 22 Respondents noting 
their importance (Figure 7). These factors are 
interrelated since many companies pulled away 
from the VCM during a period of intense media 
scrutiny to avoid accusations of greenwashing 
their greenhouse gas emissions. The pace of 
credit issuances by standards was cited by 11 
Respondents as an important influence on credit 
sales; a slowdown in issuances for some project 
types is also related to media scrutiny of the VCM.
When reflecting on the trajectory of the VCM 
in 2023 and beyond, many Respondents noted 
that 2023 felt like a transitional year for carbon 
markets, as both the supply and demand of 
carbon credits became increasingly sophisticated 
and delineated into specific segments. 
Respondents were optimistic about the potential 
impact of the ICVCM’s Core Carbon Principles 
and the VCMI Claims Code, while noting that it 
will take time for buyers to fully parse the relevant 
requirements to make robust offsetting claims 
using these tools. 
The focus on credits that deliver environmental 
and social co-benefits was even clearer in the 
qualitative responses that EM received than the 
quantitative transaction data was, indicating that 
co-benefits are top of mind and suggesting that EM Respondent Views on the VCM  
in 2023
credits from projects delivering these benefits 
could continue to grow in market share. Looking 
beyond the VCM, several respondents noted that, 
in some cases, biodiversity benefits were in some 
cases the primary reason for a credit purchase, 
suggesting potential demand for future 
biodiversity credit markets.

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2024    21
Despite a contraction within the VCM in 2023, 
we find ourselves in a transformational period 
as many segments of supply and demand 
continue to grow across global carbon markets. 
EM’s transaction data illustrate how the 
Household/Community Devices category, led by 
Cookstove Distribution projects, has become an 
important source for credits that provide co-
benefits beyond carbon emissions reductions. 
Transaction volumes for the Forestry and Land 
Use category dropped following high-profile 
scrutiny of REDD+ project methodologies, 
but increasing project registrations and credit 
retirements in this category indicate that long-
term supply and demand for these credits 
is robust. At the same time, credits from 
the Renewable Energy and Transportation 
categories continue to lose market share as 
more up-to-date methodologies for Energy 
Efficiency and Chemical Processes/Industrial 
Manufacturing projects offer more attractive 
options for buyers searching for less expensive 
credits from higher-income countries.
EM analyses also suggest that credit standards 
have responded to shifts in the VCM in different 
ways. Gold Standard, ACR, and CAR credits all 
gained market share, while VCS and CDM credits 
made up smaller portions of the market. The 
decline in the volume of VCS credits traded in 
2023 was related to Verra’s overhaul of the VCS 
consolidated REDD+ methodology, while the 
supply of CDM credits has dwindled as its status 
remains in limbo pending transition to Article 6. 
A growing portion of traded credits associated 
with additional benefits indicated that co-
benefits became more relevant across standards, 
even as the premium associated with these 
co-benefits dropped slightly as projects from 
the Household/Community Devices category 
contributed to the available supply.Looking ahead at the future of the VCM, 
EM experts see many possible pathways for 
expansion in 2024. Carbon markets could shift 
in emphasis towards pure carbon removals or 
towards credits with robust co-benefits, or both 
types of credits could continue to find different 
use cases, as 2023 data indicate. Market integrity 
initiatives, such as VCMI and ICVCM, as well as 
independent ratings agencies are stepping in to 
guide buyers and project developers on high-
integrity credits. New project types continue 
to be introduced and old methodologies are 
revised, bringing new sources of supply into 
the market and changing buyer perceptions 
of which credits can be used to credibly claim 
emissions offsets. Market actors continue to wait 
for clarity on both Article 6 trading mechanisms 
and SBTi’s decision on how end users can claim 
carbon credits against their Scope 3 emissions 
reduction goals, both of which will likely increase 
total demand and constrain the supply of carbon 
credits.
One thing remains clear as we reflect on the 
trajectory of the carbon markets over the 
next few years: in the VCM, there is always 
nuance to the meaning of carbon accounting 
decisions, and tradeoffs to be made between 
easily measured greenhouse gas impacts and 
benefits and safeguards to local communities 
and environments. So far, it has been the work of 
thousands of project developers, credit issuing 
standards, providers of assurance and verification, 
investors, speculators, credit aggregators, and 
corporate credit buyers to make the VCM a 
meaningful market that can drive investment 
towards decarbonization and green economies. 
In 2023, the VCM has made meaningful strides 
towards maturity. We look forward to following 
and sharing emerging policies and trends as the 
VCM continues to evolve.

Data and Methodology
Most of the data in this report come from self-reported transaction data from EM Respondents, 
typically project developers, investors, and intermediaries (i.e., sell-side market participants). Data 
on project registrations, credit issuances, and credit retirements are sourced from carbon standard 
registries.
Average carbon credit prices are volume-weighted, calculated from transactions with reported price 
and volume (the majority of transactions reported to EM). To calculate the total transaction value, 
this average price is multiplied by the total volume of transactions (including transactions without 
an associated price). In other words, the volume-weighted average price for transactions with price is 
assumed to extend to transactions reported without price.
For project registrations, only projects that had been approved by the relevant registry were 
included, whether or not credits were issued for projects. EM experts used the provided project 
registration date where available; for Gold Standard projects, the date of the first credit issuance for a 
project was used for the date of project registration. Any reserve or buffer volume from registry data 
on issued credits was removed, where provided data made that possible.
EM is the world’s largest repository of VCM transaction data, however, the volumes presented 
throughout this report should not be considered to be a complete representation of market trading 
activity. EM works actively to engage with all market participants. As reporting to EM is voluntary, 
and many market actors are not yet reporting to EM, the actual volume of credits transacted in 
the voluntary market is likely higher than the amounts published here. See a list of current EM 
Respondents below.

Glossary of Terms
Additionality:  Additionality describes the basis for issuing carbon credits for project activities that 
would not occur without finance from the sale of credits. Carbon credits can only be issued if the 
reduction or removal of carbon emissions would not otherwise have taken place. For example, a 
solar energy installation that would be profitable to build without the sale of carbon credits is not 
considered additional, but a cookstove distribution project that reduces the burden of deforestation 
is additional, because deforestation would continue at a high rate if the cookstoves were not supplied 
to local communities. Different project methodologies have specific modules for calculating project 
additionality.
Afforestation-Reforesation and Revegetation (ARR): A group of Forestry and Land Use project 
types that establish new forests or restore deforested/degraded forests through tree planting and 
revegetation. ARR projects generate nature-based removal credits.
Article 6: An article of the 2016 Paris Agreement that covers collaboration between countries in 
pursuit of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. See Box 2, page 16 for details. 
Blue Carbon: A group of Forestry and Land Use project types that reduce/remove carbon dioxide 
from marine and coastal environments by restoring, conserving, or managing ecosystems, including 
wetland, mangrove, and seagrass habitats.
Co-benefits: Social or environmental benefits provided by a project in addition to the greenhouse 
gas emission reductions/removals that generate carbon credits. For example, a project that restores 
natural ecosystems and has benefits for carbon storage, biodiversity, and local communities. Credit 
standards can indicate if a project provides certain co-benefits through independent certifications 
(e.g., Verra’s Climate, Community, and Biodiversity certification for projects that contribute to 
biodiversity) or by indicating which UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the projects 
contribute towards.
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA): A compliance 
program for offsetting emissions from international aviation, operated by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO). Only certain credits that meet ICAO’s eligibility criteria – specific 
standards, methodologies, co-benefits, project locations, and vintages – can be used as offsets for 
CORSIA. CORSIA’s pilot phase ran from 2021 to 2023, and its first implementation phase began in 
2024. 
Corresponding adjustment: An additional agreement required as part of Article 6 (see above) that 
prevents project host countries from counting credits they trade towards their own NDCs, which 
would result in the credits being “double-counted” by both the host country and the buying country.
Credits: The individual units of greenhouse gas emissions reducing/removing activities that are 
issued by carbon market standards, and then bought, sold, and retired by the various carbon market 
actors (project developers, intermediaries, end users, etc.). Each credit is denominated as one 
metric ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) and corresponds to the estimated amount of greenhouse gas 
emissions that a project removes or reduces from the atmosphere.
End User/End Buyer: An entity (individual, company, organization, etc.) that purchases carbon 
credits, either directly from the project developer or from an intermediary, with the intention of 
retiring the credits to claim as offsets against emissions (see Retirements).
Engineered credits: Credits generated by projects that use technological solutions to reduce or 
remove greenhouse gas emissions. This includes projects in the following categories: Chemical
