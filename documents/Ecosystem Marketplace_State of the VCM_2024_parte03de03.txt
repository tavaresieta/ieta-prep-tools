Processes/Industrial Manufacturing, Energy Efficiency/Fuel Switching, Household/Community 
Devices, Renewable Energy, Transportation, and Waste Disposal.
Greenhouse Gases (GHGs): Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and lead to global warming. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide are the primary greenhouse gases emitted into the 
atmosphere by human activities contributing to climate change.
Greenwashing: Misleading characterizations of corporate actions to address environmental issues 
that make company efforts seem more impactful than they are. Companies claiming emissions 
offsets using low-quality carbon credits face the risk of being accused of greenwashing.
Improved Forest Management (IFM): A group of Forestry and Land Use project types that 
implement forest management activities to increase carbon storage in forests, and/or reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions from forestry activities. This cluster does not include projects that fall 
under the REDD+ framework (see REDD+). 
Intermediary: Organizations that purchase and take ownership of carbon credits but are not end 
users. This includes retailers and aggregators that take ownership of offsets from project developers 
and sell them to end users for a profit. EM does not include brokers that sell carbon credits on 
behalf of project developers but do not take ownership of credits in the category of intermediaries, 
including these market participants with end users.
Issuance: When a credit is made available for sale, following the issuing standard’s requirements 
for verification by a third-party auditor. Each issued credit has a unique serial number and any 
ownership transfers or retirements must be reported to the issuing standard’s registry. 
Methodology: The technical documentation that describes the procedures and requirements 
for specific types of project activities, including procedures for quantifying the volume of 
greenhouse gas emissions reduced and/or removed by the project. Some projects will use multiple 
methodologies to cover different elements within a single project. Standards may develop their own 
methodology documentation and/or provide a list of methodologies from other standards that they 
will accept. 
Nature-based credits: Credits generated by projects that achieve greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions or removals by conserving, restoring, and/or managing natural and agricultural 
ecosystems. All projects within EM’s Agriculture and Forestry and Land Use categories are considered 
nature-based. 
Net-Zero: An organization is considered to have achieved net zero emissions when it reduces at least 
90 percent of initial emissions and compensates for the residual emissions through offsetting with 
carbon credits. Net-zero is a more stringent standard than the related term “carbon neutral,” which 
does not require emissions abatement and can be accomplished through emissions offsets alone.
Project Category:  Category is the broadest classification level that EM uses to group projects by 
the type of activities involved. EM has eight Project Categories: Agriculture, Chemical Processing / 
Industrial Manufacturing, Energy Efficiency and Fuel Switching, Forestry and Land Use, Household / 
Community Devices, Renewable Energy, Transportation, and Waste Disposal. Within each category, 
EM groups projects into more specific Project Clusters and the most specific Project Types.
Project registration: When a credit-issuing standard determines that a prospective project meets 
the necessary criteria established in a published methodology, including third-party validation and 
assurance, and gives official approval to list the project in that standard’s registry. Once registered, a 
project can submit requests for credit issuances (see Issuances).

REDD+: Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in Developing Countries. These 
Forestry and Land Use projects are developed based on the voluntary REDD+ framework, developed 
by the UNFCCC to encourage financing of forest conservation and management in lower income 
countries where forests are at risk of land-use change or reduced carbon storage.
Reduction credits: Credits generated by projects from the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that 
were reduced or avoided through project activities. For example, a project that improves building 
weatherization and thereby reduces the burden of emissions from heating or air conditioning. 
Some nature-based carbon projects both reduce and remove (see Removal credits) greenhouse gas 
emissions and credits from these projects are considered to include both reduction and removal 
credits.
Removal credits: Credits generated from the volume of greenhouse gas emissions that a project 
removed from the atmosphere or ocean through the creation of a carbon sink/pool. For example, an 
ARR project that increases vegetation to sequester carbon.
Registry: An inventory of the credits that are issued, retired, held, or transferred by a carbon credit 
issuing standard.
Retirement: When a uniquely serialized carbon credit is removed from circulation in the market and 
can no longer be transferred or sold. This occurs once the credit has been sold to its end user, but this 
may or may not happen immediately after the end user takes ownership of the credit. By retiring the 
credit, the end user can claim to have offset emissions from its carbon footprint against an emissions 
target.
Scope 3 emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions that are indirectly caused by a company through any 
activities other than the generation of purchased energy. A major source of Scope 3 emissions is a 
company’s value chain, which includes emissions from both upstream (e.g., agricultural production) 
and downstream (e.g., use and disposal of products by consumers) supply chains. For some 
companies, such as those in consumer goods sectors that rely heavily on agricultural and forestry 
commodities, the vast majority of their carbon emissions are embedded in their value chains. 
Standard: A set of project design, monitoring, and reporting criteria against which carbon offsetting 
activities and/or projects’ environmental and social co-benefits can be certified or verified. Some 
standards certify/verify thousands of projects from a wide range of types and geographic locations, 
while others are specific to certain project types or geographic locations. For example, the UK 
Woodland Carbon Code specifically covers afforestation projects within the United Kingdom.
Vintage: The year in which project emissions reductions or removals were determined to have 
occurred (or estimated to occur in the future). This does not have to match the year that the credits 
were issued; there can be lags between the actual reductions/removals and the issuance of credits, 
and some standards issue credits for future estimated reductions/removals.
