About Ecosystem Marketplace
Ecosystem Marketplace (EM), a non-profit initiative of Forest Trends, is a leading global source of credible 
information on environmental finance, markets, and payments for ecosystem services. For nearly two 
decades, EM has run the world’s first and only globally recognized and standardized reporting and 
transparency platform for voluntary carbon market (VCM) credit pricing data, news, and insights.  
EM’s flagship State of the Voluntary Carbon Market reports and other analyses on carbon credit 
market dynamics (e.g., prices, volumes, projects, corporate buyers, sellers, etc.) and carbon standard 
issuance and retirement data have become anticipated industry staples. EM also provides a publicly 
accessible data intelligence dashboard  and a news platform  for market coverage.
EM data on prices, regulation, science, and other relevant issues on environmental services markets 
and climate finance have been used extensively by a range of market actors, from companies, 
journalists, and investors, to practitioners, natural resource agencies, academics, and local and 
indigenous communities

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2025    1
Over the 20-year history of Forest Trends’ 
Ecosystem Marketplace (EM), we have seen 
carbon markets grow from a nascent idea into 
a mechanism with the potential to seriously 
mitigate global warming. State of the Voluntary 
Carbon Market reports have highlighted market 
trends and key developments in this actively 
evolving space, which has grown to meet 
a steady demand to offset greenhouse gas 
emissions (approximately 180-200 million tons 
of credits retired annually since 2021). Today, we 
continue to follow refinements in quality and 
integrity as the voluntary carbon market (VCM) 
works to transition to a new phase which reflects 
a greater focus on nature-based solutions, 
carbon removals, and interoperability with 
international compliance carbon markets. 
While it will be tempting to readers to interpret 
the headline figures in this year’s State of the 
Voluntary Carbon Market as a sign of weak 
demand for carbon credits, there is actually 
a very different explanation. This comes from 
EM’s longitudinal experience and the “ear to the 
ground,” thanks to the global network of market 
actors who share their data and insights with us. 
What we are seeing is an ongoing reboot of 
the supply side of the VCM, in response to the 
growing sophistication of the demand side of 
the market. The legacy market of credits from 
older methodologies is winding down, while the 
next phase of the VCM, with a stronger emphasis 
on integrity, ramps up to scale. It is going to 
take time for the supply of credits to become 
available from new projects. In the meantime, 
steady demand from the end users of credits is 
pushing up the price of credits from the existing 
project types that are considered to be high 
quality. This could be a bumpy ride. The VCM is 
in the middle of a transition, and transitions take 
time and are often messy.
It is also important to note that while VCM 
transaction volumes have seen volatility of late, 
both across the complete market and within 
individual categories and project types, the 
pace of credit retirements has been much more stable over the past four years. This suggests that 
demand from end users retiring credits remains 
consistent. 
It is not easy to separate these kinds of signals 
from the noise. The opacity of the VCM is one 
of its biggest weaknesses. Our position has 
long been that for the VCM to transition to a 
state of confidence and integrity, it must have 
transparency. Market actors and observers alike 
need access to reliable information to make 
informed decisions and accurately interpret why 
certain credits fetch certain prices and what that 
signals to the market. 
As a community of practice working toward 
a common goal of driving investment in 
decarbonization and climate resiliency, VCM 
participants are laying the groundwork for 
businesses, institutions, and individuals to 
participate in multiple climate action pathways 
that fit their needs and values. These financial 
instruments are critical to bridging the major 
climate finance gaps that are so desperately 
needed. The shifts we’re seeing in the market 
reflect the increasing sophistication and growing 
technical expertise of market actors and 
observers alike, especially compared to five years 
ago, ten years ago, and the very early days of the 
VCM. 
After intense and sustained scrutiny of the VCM 
following a rapid increase in credit transaction 
and retirement volume in 2021 and 2022, we’ve 
seen market actors focus on rebuilding trust by 
creating guardrails to ensure market “integrity.” 
This process has led to a flight to quality, with 
market actors learning by doing as they try to 
build consensus on and operationalize ever-more 
robust definitions of quality and integrity on 
both the supply and demand sides. In 2024, the 
ongoing decline in market value and transaction 
volume slowed, with demand growing for credits 
with multiple dimensions of integrity and quality. 
This served to bolster transaction volume for 
project types like Improved Forest Management 
and Landfill Gas Destruction, while other credit 
types that were constrained by supply saw Introduction

credits.
The data and insights in this report are the 
product of deep collaboration and mutual trust 
across the broadest network of market actors 
on the ground and stakeholders across the VCM 
value chain. Our team and network of advisors 
provide diligent analysis of market trends, 
informed by our collective and hard-earned 
wisdom over the last 20 years. By the time you 
read this, the report will be in the hands of our 
global audience of over 40,000 individuals who 
have come to rely on our work as a critical source 
of knowledge to understand the present state 
of the market, where it’s going, and how those 
dynamics continue to play out in terms of the 
larger climate impact of the VCM.We are deeply proud of these relationships and 
the credibility we’ve built over two decades. 
We know that our Respondents trust EM with 
their sensitive, confidential data because they 
also believe market transparency matters. 
We remain committed to delivering market 
analysis that bridges the knowledge gap 
and helps our readers understand opaque 
elements and segments of the market, but as a 
non-profit count on you to support this critical 
work.
It is our hope that the 2025 State of the 
Voluntary Carbon Market report will provide 
an indication of the most important issues 
facing the VCM in 2024 and beyond, as well as 
a glimpse of what can come next as the VCM 
continues to evolve to meet higher standards of 
quality and integrity.

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2025    3
Key Findings
1. Total market transaction volume declined 
by 25 percent and average price declined by 
5.5 percent in 2024.
 ●The total reported transaction value of the 
Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) was $535M 
USD, a decrease of 29 percent from 2023.
 ●The ongoing decline in the VCM that began 
in 2022 is gradually slowing. 2024 posted 
the lowest transaction volume since 2018, 
but market value is 1.9x higher than 2018.
2. While transaction volume, which is a proxy 
for VCM liquidity, continued to decline in 
2024, the volume of credits retired from the 
ten largest standards has plateaued at an 
elevated level since 2021, with 182 million 
tons of credits retired in 2024.
 ●Retirements of Forestry and Land Use 
credits remain steady at 68 million tons per 
year. Given concurrent declining retirements 
of Renewable Energy, Forestry and Land use 
became the most frequently retired credit 
type in 2024.
 ●Credits from Household/Community 
Devices projects made up an increased 
share of retired offsets, reflecting sustained 
growth in project registrations and 
issuances in the category.
3. There is a growing premium on credits 
from projects that remove carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere and sequester it in 
natural or engineered carbon pools. On 
average, removal credits are 381 percent more 
expensive than reduction credits in 2024—up 
from 245 percent in 2023.
 ●Market share of removal credits has 
continued to grow slowly. Five percent 
of credits traded in 2024 originated from 
removal project types.
 ●The price premium for removals substantially 
benefits nature-based credits from 
Afforestation-Reforestation/Revegetation (ARR), mangrove restoration, and agroforestry 
projects, which are the largest category of 
removal credits available today.
4. The Integrity Council for the Voluntary 
Carbon Market’s (ICVCM) Core Carbon 
Principles (CCPs) approval took center stage 
as an indicator of high quality.  Since only 
a relatively small share of project types was 
effectively approved during 2024 though, the 
effect on demand was isolated and overall 
market impact was relatively minimal.
 ●Demand for Landfill Gas and Ozone 
Depleting Substances credits grew. 
 ●CCP-approved Reduced Emissions 
from Deforestation and Degradation in 
Developing Countries (REDD+) and ARR 
credits are not available on the market yet. 
5. Different categories of credits had different 
trajectories. Some categories gained market 
share while others saw volume or prices slip. 
 ●Forestry and Land Use transaction volume 
remained stable , with average price 
declining in line with the broader market. 
 ○REDD+ continues to decline in market 
share (transaction volume fell 52 percent) 
while Improved Forest Management 
(IFM) saw explosive growth (transaction 
volumes grew over 3x). 
 ○ARR, Agroforestry, and Blue Carbon 
projects, which generate removal credits, 
saw average price increase by 20 percent. 
 ●Waste Disposal volume grew over 3x, 
driven by demand for CCP-approved 
Landfill Gas credits. 
 ○Biochar Production, which generates 
removal credits and is one of the smallest 
clusters in terms of transaction volume, 
had an average price of over $160 /metric 
ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e), 
over 25x the total market average price.

 ●Credits from Renewable Energy projects 
continued to lose market share , with 
transaction volume decreasing 23 percent 
in 2024. 
 ○Credits from biogas projects, which 
include Landfill Gas to Energy projects 
that may be eligible for CCP approval, 
are becoming more expensive while all 
other Renewable Energy clusters are 
seeing prices steadily decline. 6. Buyer preference for credits from recent 
vintages reached unprecedented levels.  
There was a 217 percent premium for 
credits with vintage from the last five years, 
compared to a 53 percent premium in 2023. 
7. Carbon market participants anticipate a 
positive impact on demand and supply 
in the VCM from Article 6 of the Paris 
Agreement , but market participants don’t 
view local jurisdictions as ready to engage 
with and implement Article 6 mechanisms.

State of the Voluntary Carbon Market 2025    5
Total Volume, Value, and Price 
 ●2024 marked the third year in a row of 
declining VCM transaction volume and 
market value, as the market continues to 
face dramatic fluctuations in fundamental 
supply and demand from credit standards 
and end users retiring credits.
 ●Total market value fell by 29 percent to 
$535M, a similar total value as in 2020, but 
this value was achieved with 84 MtCO2e of 
credits sold—just 40 percent of the 2020 
transaction volume.
 ●The volume of credit retirements has 
remained steady even as issuance and 
transaction volume are in decline, indicating 
sustained fundamental demand for carbon 
credits even as market liquidity is strained.
 ●As a result, credit prices have remained 
structurally higher over the past three 
years. The average transaction price of 
$6.37 in 2024 was more than double the 
2020 average price. 
The past five years of market activity in the VCM 
have been marked by extreme swings in supply 
and demand: annual sales of carbon credits 
spiked in 2021 and have declined ever since, 
while retirement volumes remain elevated from 
2021 onwards. For the third consecutive year, 
transaction volume and market value in the 
VCM declined in 2024, with EM Respondents submitting transaction data totaling 84 million 
metric tons CO2e (MtCO2e), representing a 25 
percent fall in traded volume from the previous 
year (Table 1). 
For the second year in a row, Respondents 
reported transacting fewer credits than were 
retired from the top ten carbon credit standards, 
suggesting declining inventories of the most 
sought-after credits in the face of sustained 
demand and bottlenecks in supply of new credits.
This was also the second year in a row of 
declining prices after a peak in 2022 of $7.37/
tCO2e. However, the rate of market contraction 
slowed in 2024 as credit prices held firm above 
$6/tCO2e, more than double the average credit 
price in 2020 (Figure 1). Average credit prices fell 
slightly from $6.71/tCO2e to $6.34/tCO2e, down 
six percent year-over-year. As a result of drops 
in both transaction volume and price, the total 
market value of the VCM fell by 29 percent, with 
a total value of $535M reported to EM in 2024 
(Figure 2). This is a similar total value as was 
reported in 2020—however, given higher average 
prices in 2024, the volume of credit transactions 
required to generate that value was only 40 
percent of the total volume in 2020 (Figure 3).
EM’s estimates of transaction volume and market 
value are lower bounds for the VCM based on 
transaction data from actual credit sales, received 
from 82 EM Respondents with transactions in 
2024, compared to 97 Respondents that reported 
transaction data in 2023. To understand the effect 
of the declining numbers of Respondents, we 
compared the transaction volume and average Market Overview

price for 61 Respondents who submitted data 
for both 2023 and 2024. Interestingly, this group 
saw a greater decline in reported transaction 
volume and average credit price in 2024 than 
the full sample of Respondents, whose volume 
declined by 31 percent and average price declined 
by 20 percent. New Respondents, on the other 
hand, saw an average transaction price that was 
58 percent greater than the market average. 
While some new EM Respondents represent 
novel sources of supply from more expensive 
project types, like European nature-based 
projects, others are established VCM actors with 
a broader scope. Both types of new Respondents 
providing transaction data in 2024 added to the 
completeness of EM’s network of carbon market 
actors and improved the quality of the analysis in 
this report. Market sentiments from Respondents 
completing our qualitative survey confirm the 
diversity of outcomes for market participants in 
2024 (see EM Respondent Sentiments on the 
VCM in 2024, p. 29)Further disaggregating transaction data by 
project category, region of origin, credit vintage, 
and other qualities of carbon credits supports 
the conclusion that the VCM is continuing a 
period of steady, comprehensive transformation 
after the un precedented acceleration in market 
activity beginning in 2020. The continuing 
contraction is a transition from the exceptional 
period from 2020 to 2021, when the average 
annual market value was $2B per year (Figure 3). 
Over the last two years, as the VCM was subject 
to intense internal and external scrutiny, market 
actors have worked to develop the new project 
types, credit stan dards, governing boards, and 
independent quality evaluators that the VCM will 
need to sustain and scale for the next decades 
of climate action. The quantitative data in this 
report, as well as qualitative data gathered 
from our network of Respon dents, indicate a 
complex trajectory for the VCM, but one which 
gives market actors some cause for moderate 
optimism looking at 2025 and beyond.Figure 3. Voluntary Carbon Market Size by Volume of Traded Carbon Credits, pre-2005 to 2024

In the VCM and compliance carbon markets, one term that is used repeatedly in different contexts is 
“registry.” Depending on the situation, a registry can be a tool used by credit issuers or a database of 
credits that tracks what can be sold and retired for specific needs, e.g., compliance demand.
Key Terms
Standards: The organizations that define the project activities that can produce carbon credits 
and publish methodologies outlining the calculation of credits generated by a project, as well as 
approving and tracking project registration and credit issuance and retirement.
Registries: Can refer either to databases of registered projects and issued and retired credits 
maintained by standards, or to aggregations of credits meeting certain criteria, such as eligibility for 
use in a compliance carbon market.
Registration: Projects must pass through a series of design validation and auditing steps, including 
potential public comment periods, before they are approved by standards and given registered 
status.
Issuance: Following a project’s registration, once it begins to generate emissions reductions or 
removals, a third-party auditor will verify that the methodology applied in the project design is 
being followed and confirm that the climate impact of the project is in line with expectations, 
allowing the standard to issue credits to the project developer.
Retirement: A credit may be passed through many hands from the project’s developer, or it may 
be sold directly to its end user, who will “retire” the credit by requesting the standard to add the 
specific credit to its registry of retired credits.
Registries by Issuers – Publishing Credit Supply
Probably the most common use of “registry” in a carbon market context is to refer to the 
organizations that issue carbon credits and must maintain publicly available databases of carbon 
projects and how many credits these projects have issued and had retired. When credits change 
hands or are retired, account holders must inform the registry, which provides the single source 
of truth regarding which credits have been used as offsets. Credit issuing standards publish 
their registries to make credit buyers aware of existing supply and demand and planned future 
developments. The timely maintenance of these registries is such a major part of the function of 
carbon standards that the entire category of standards is sometimes referred to as “registries.” 
Registries may be maintained directly by standards (e.g. Verra manages its own VCS registry) or by 
third parties (e.g., Cercarbono’s registry, which is maintained by EcoRegistry).
Registries for Credit Users – Aggregating Acceptable Offsets
For end users of carbon credits who need to meet compliance requirements, another use case for 
a registry is to organize and track eligible credits from the VCM that can be used to offset covered 
emissions. This is most common when a compliance system allows credits from more than one 
standard for offsetting emissions. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization’s Carbon 
Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) program allows the use of 
credits from six different carbon standards during the first implementation phase, and information 
on the credits that are retired under CORSIA is accounted for in the CORSIA Central Registry. Article 
6.2 implementation also requires the establishment of national registries that contain information 
on credits that are traded in bilateral or multilateral transactions, and an international registry to 
record the transfer of these credits between jurisdictions. At COP29 in Baku last year, negotiators 
confirmed that countries participating in Article 6.2 will have the option to develop their own 
national registry, or to use the same infrastructure as the international registry to be maintained by 
the UN (see Box 3, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, p 27).Box 1: What Is a Registry? Defining The Mechanics of Carbon Markets

Registry Data – Project Registrations, 
Issuances, and Retirements
 ●Project registrations declined slightly, down 
11 percent from 2023. Between 600-700 new 
projects have been registered with major 
carbon standards annually from 2022 to 2024, 
with categories like Household/Community 
devices and Agriculture gaining prevalence.
 ●The volume of credits issued fell 20 percent, 
led by declining issuances from Renewable 
Energy and Forestry and Land Use projects, 
which is expected due to the slowdown in 
project registrations from these categories 
since 2020.
 ●Credit retirements declined slightly to 182 
million credits retired in 2024 from 189 
million credits retired in 2023, which still 
represents a sustained increase in annual   retirements since 2020 and a fairly steady 
rate of retirement for the last four years. 
Retirements of Forestry and Land Use 
projects held steady while Household/
Community Devices were an area of growth.
 ●Buyers are retiring credits from Forestry 
and Land Use and Agriculture projects 
faster than project developers can issue 
them, and at an accelerating pace. 
IEM transaction data tracks sales of carbon 
credits in terms of volumes and average 
prices for confirmed over-the-counter (OTC) 
and exchange-based trades. This allows us to 
provide a precise measurement of the lower 
bound of VCM volume and total market value 
for transactions that took place during a given 
year. Data from the project registries maintained 
by credit issuing standards can round out our 
understanding of the supply and demand of 
carbon credits over the course of a given year.

Across the ten major standards tracked by EM, 
616 new carbon projects were registered in 2024, 
down from 694 registered in 2023, but equal to 
the total number of projects registered in 2022. 
The greatest decline in project registrations was 
seen in the Household/Community Devices 
category, which was the leading category for 
new project registrations in 2023 (Figure 4). Total 
credit issuances fell from 390 million in 2023 to 311 
million in 2024 (Figure 5), with Renewable Energy 
and Forestry and Land Use, the largest categories, 
accounting for the greatest proportional decline 
in issuances. The Household/Community Devices 
category saw 9 million more credits issued 
in 2024 than 2023, the largest increase of any 
category (Figure 6). This demonstrates the long 
lag times from project registration to credit 
issuance and sales to final credit retirement. With 
more Household/Community Devices projects 
registered in 2022 and 2023, more projects 
completed their initial measurement, reporting, 
and verification (MRV) periods and sold carbon 
credits in 2024, and we can expect to see this 
delayed effect continue into the near future.Looking at the end of the credit lifecycle, 
registries reported that 180 million credits 
were retired in 2024, down slightly from 188 
million in 2023. Most categories of projects 
saw a decline in the volume of credits retired, 
including Renewable Energy, which was the 
most commonly retired category, with 67 million 
credits retired in 2024 compared to 80 million in 
2023. Forestry and Land Use and Transportation 
credit retirements held steady at 66 million 
credits and 33 million credits retired in 2024, 
respectively. Household and Community Devices 
credits saw the greatest growth in retirement 
volume in 2024 with 68 million credits retired, 
and Waste Disposal and Agriculture credits were 
also retired in higher numbers over the past year 
with 4 million credits retired. In Agriculture, the 
smallest category in terms of credit issuances 
and retirements, retirement volume grew by 60 
percent over the last year with nearly 3 million 
credits retired (Table 2).
