State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 20259
Foreword
Governments today face immense fiscal pressure amid a complex and 
uncertain economic environment. Low economic growth projections and 
rising volatility in trade and financial markets are placing additional pressures 
on public budgets. These converging pressures are not only threatening fiscal 
resilience but also undermining development gains. 
In this context, carbon pricing offers a powerful tool. It can mobilize finance 
and secure development outcomes even during periods of uncertainty. 
It mobilizes domestic revenue, drives efficiency and innovation, and attracts 
international finance—all while helping countries advance climate and 
development goals. It’s a pragmatic solution at a time when resources are tight, 
and ambitions are high.
We saw continued momentum over the past year, particularly among large 
middle-income economies. China’s expansion of carbon pricing brought 
three gigatons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under its emissions trading 
system. Today, around 28% of global emissions are covered by a direct carbon 
price and economies representing nearly two-thirds of global economic output 
have implemented either a carbon tax or emissions trading system. More 
countries, including Brazil, India, and Türkiye, are moving forward with domestic 
carbon pricing frameworks. Others, including Zambia, Tanzania, Paraguay, and 
Viet Nam, are positioning themselves to participate in international carbon 
markets. 
Carbon markets are also increasing globally. Carbon credit markets play 
multiple roles. They support climate commitments, lower the cost of new 
technologies, and finance nature-based solutions like forest restoration. But 
they do more than just carbon savings; they deliver development dividends in terms of more affordable energy access, cleaner cooking fuels, and healthier 
forests, to name just a few.
We are also seeing innovation. The emergence of new insurance products—
including a political risk guarantee issued by our Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency—are helping de -risk investments in international carbon 
markets and support private sector participation.
The private sector plays a critical role. Companies are increasingly subject to 
compliance requirements under new and expanding carbon pricing schemes. 
To scale impact, there is a growing demand for safe, efficient, and interoperable 
transaction infrastructure to incentivize more private sector revenues. 
The growth from fewer than 10 instruments in 2005 to 80 today is a 
reminder of global progress on direct carbon pricing. For over 20 years, the 
State and Trends of Carbon Pricing report series has provided an important 
global pulse check–offering rigorous, evidence-based insights into policies 
and market developments. The World Bank seeks to provide knowledge that 
can drive development and scale impactful solutions. I hope this year’s report 
continues to inform action, inspire innovation, and strengthen partnerships 
across public and private sectors.

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202511
 
Direct carbon pricing continues to mobilize 
over $100 billion for public budgets
• Carbon prices held relatively steady in real 
terms, but with variation across jurisdictions. 
• Carbon revenue in 2024 was lower than 
2023, largely due to lower prices in large 
ETSs, such as the EU and the UK, but it was 
over three times higher than a decade ago, in 
real terms.
• Over half of carbon revenues generated in 
2024 were earmarked towards environment, 
infrastructure, and development projects—a 
slight increase compared to previous years. 
Expansion of carbon taxes and ETSs has 
increased the proportion of global emissions 
and economic output being subjected to a 
direct carbon price
• The expansion of China’s ETS to industrial 
sectors has increased global direct carbon 
pricing coverage from 24% to around 28%.
• The economies that have implemented either 
a carbon tax or an ETS make up almost two-
thirds of global gross domestic product.
• Over half of global emissions from the power 
sector and almost half of the industry sector 
face a direct carbon price.
• Coverage in other sectors is lower, with 
agricultural emissions remaining unpriced.CARBON PRICING
All large middle-income economies have 
either implemented or are considering direct 
carbon pricing
• There are 80 carbon taxes and emissions 
trading systems (ETSs) in operation 
worldwide—a net increase of five over the 
last 12 months. 
• Brazil, India, and Türkiye have met key 
milestones to facilitate ETS implementation, 
while Colombia and Indonesia expanded 
coverage.
• Most new and planned instruments are 
ETSs. While designs vary, many governments 
including India have selected a rate-based 
approach.

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202512
 
Credit prices softened slightly, but with 
observed premiums for specific credit types
• Nature-based removal credits attracted 
premiums and high forward prices, 
suggesting voluntary buyers are willing 
to pay more for these credits relative to 
alternative credit types. 
• A positive correlation is also emerging 
between prices and carbon credit ratings 
from proprietary ratings providers. 
• Credits eligible for use in international 
compliance markets command a price 
premium compared to credits eligible for use 
in voluntary markets. 
There is a growing surplus of unretired 
credits in the market
• Global supply of credits declined slightly, 
but supply trends varied across categories, 
with issuances from nature-based removal 
projects increasing compared to 2023.
• The pool of unretired carbon credits 
from independent crediting mechanisms 
increased to almost 1 billion tons. Most of 
these unretired credits are relatively old 
(issued before 2022) and are from forestry 
and land use or renewable energy projects.
• Governmental crediting mechanisms, such 
as the Australian Carbon Credit Unit Scheme 
and the Kazakhstan Crediting Mechanism, 
accounted for just over 10% of total global 
credit issuances.CARBON CREDIT MARKETS
Global carbon credit retirements increased 
due to a short-term spike in demand for 
compliance purposes
• The private sector continues to lead demand 
for carbon credits through voluntary and 
domestic compliance markets, emphasizing 
the role of carbon markets in channeling 
private capital toward decarbonization 
projects.
• Compliance retirements in 2024 were almost 
three times the 2023 level. Most were from 
companies looking to meet their multi-year 
compliance obligations under the California 
and Québec ETSs.
• Voluntary buyer preferences shifted toward 
nature-based removal and clean cooking 
projects.
• The first phase of international aviation’s 
Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for 
International Aviation commenced in 2024, 
but despite some initial sales, uncertainties 
remain for both supply and demand.

CHAPTER 1
Introduction 
1.1 Governments continue to advance carbon pricing and markets in the 
context of broader economic, financial, and social considerations
The global economy is slowing amid a sharp escalation of trade tensions 
and a highly uncertain global policy environment. Earlier expectations of 
stabilization in global economic activity in 2025 following years of overlapping 
shocks have been derailed by heightened policy uncertainty, financial market 
volatility, and large shifts in the international trade policy environment. As 
noted in the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report, global growth is 
projected to slow this year to 2.3%, remaining well below the pre-pandemic 
10-year average of 3.1%.1 This subdued outlook is driven by increased trade 
barriers, elevated uncertainty, and deteriorating confidence. At the same time, 
rising global public debt, expected to approach 100% of global gross domestic 
product (GDP) by 2030, continues to strain economies, contributing to financial 
instability.2
Climate change places further pressure on economic and development 
outcomes. More frequent and severe extreme weather events are damaging 
infrastructure, driving up the costs of disaster recovery, and disrupting 
supply chains. These events divert resources from critical areas, such as 
health, education, and employment, disproportionately affecting low-income 
communities and economies.3 In addition, asymmetrical policy responses 
create risks for economies. For example, changes to the global policy 
landscape, the rapid introduction of new technologies, and shifts in consumer 
and investor preferences are disrupting existing markets and supply chains. This can undermine countries’ competitiveness, economic growth, and fiscal 
sustainability, including through a heightened potential for stranded assets 
and large shifts to the tax base.4 If not managed effectively, the risks posed by 
climate change can undermine economic stability and development, increase 
uncertainty, and further weaken long-term economic growth prospects. 
Countries are using carbon pricing to work toward multiple policy 
objectives. In addition to using direct carbon pricing as a tool to meet 
emissions reduction targets (see Box 1), governments have broader objectives. 
Carbon pricing is a potential source of revenue for fiscally constrained 
governments. With an expected contractionary fiscal environment in the 
coming years, raising domestic revenue with positive job and growth 
impacts will become increasingly important.5 For instance, in Mexico, 11 state 
governments have introduced carbon pricing, with revenue mobilization 
being a contributing driver. Beyond carbon pricing as a revenue stream, 
governments are also adopting carbon pricing alongside regulatory standards, 
green industrial policies, and social welfare programs to deliver structural 
changes. For example, the European Union Net-Zero Industry Act, introduced 
in 2024, complements the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) in supporting 
decarbonization in hard-to-abate industries, while in Norway, tax incentives 
combined with carbon pricing have resulted in electric cars accounting for 
nearly all new car sales. Finally, Israel has implemented a carbon tax to address 
the unpriced carbon externality and supplementary measures to improve the 
efficiency of domestic industry.6

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202515
BOX 1 
Effectiveness of emissions trading systems and carbon 
taxes 
Carbon pricing is widely recognized as an important tool to 
incentivize low-carbon economic growth. The theoretical basis for 
carbon pricing is well-established: Increasing the price of emission-
intensive goods and services relative to low-carbon alternatives creates 
an incentive for companies and individuals to move to low-carbon 
options. The effectiveness of carbon pricing is increased where price 
signals are stable, predictable, and enduring, helping to guide long-term 
investment decisions. 
However, measuring the real-world effectiveness of carbon pricing 
has historically been challenging. Because carbon pricing often 
operates alongside other policies and broader economic factors, it can 
be difficult to isolate its impact. For example, other policies such as fuel 
excise taxes and fuel subsidies influence the price signal passed through 
the economy (see Box 6 in chapter 2). Determining the counterfactual 
scenario (i.e., what emissions would have been without carbon pricing) 
is equally complex because other factors, such as business cycles and 
technological progress, also influence emissions over time. Research 
has also been constrained by the relatively recent adoption of carbon 
pricing—starting in Finland in the 1990s—as well as the prevalence of 
low initial price levels and limited coverage. Researchers have begun 
to overcome the challenges in measuring the effectiveness of carbon 
pricing, and there are more carbon pricing instruments in operation to 
feed into researchers’ evaluations. Recent research efforts are also using 
new and innovative techniques, including machine-learning-assistedmeta-analysis; advancements in econometric methods; and innovations 
in establishing counterfactual scenarios.
Recent large-scale empirical studies evaluated the effectiveness 
of carbon pricing instruments. Three large-scale studies conducted 
in 2024 provided robust empirical evidence reinforcing the theoretical 
foundation of carbon pricing as a tool to drive emissions reductions. 
Colmer et al. (2024) found that French manufacturing firms regulated by 
the EU Emissions Trading System reduced emissions by an average of 
14% between 2005 and 2007 and 16% between 2008 and 2012 as a result 
of the policy.7 Martinsson et al. (2024) found that without carbon pricing, 
Sweden’s emissions from manufacturing in 2015 would have been about 
30% higher.8 Döbbeling-Hildebrandt et al.’s (2024) meta-analysis of 
studies of 21 carbon pricing policies found that at least 17 of the policies 
produced emissions reductions of between 5% and 21%.9 Ultimately, the 
emissions reductions delivered by a carbon pricing instrument depend 
on a range of factors, including carbon price levels, the specific sectors 
covered, and access to affordable abatement opportunities.10
Carbon pricing can deliver outcomes beyond emissions reductions. 
The World Bank’s report Quantifying the Development Benefits of Carbon 
Pricing summarizes some of these broader outcomes.11 For example, by 
reducing fossil fuel combustion, carbon pricing can deliver cleaner local 
air and water, which leads to better human health outcomes. It can also 
reduce road congestion and traffic accidents.12 Additional potential
