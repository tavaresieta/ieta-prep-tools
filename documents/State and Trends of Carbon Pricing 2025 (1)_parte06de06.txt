Coverage threshold Some initiatives set a threshold above which entities must, or can, join a compliance carbon pricing instruments. There are many 
different ways of expressing these thresholds—many use an emissions threshold (e.g., installations with emissions above 25,000 
tCO2e).
Point of regulation Point source The point source is where the GHGs are physically released into the atmosphere (e.g., at the installation combusting fuel). 
Regulation at the point source is where the compliance obligation is imposed on the entities that release the covered emissions into 
the atmosphere.
Upstream The compliance obligation is imposed at a point in the supply chain before the point source of emissions entering the atmosphere. 
For example, in relation to emissions from fuel combustion, upstream coverage could be at the point at which the fuel is first 
commercialized by extractors, refiners, or importers, or at point of sale to the final consumer.
Downstream Obligations apply at a point in the supply chain after the point source of emissions. This could include entities being liable for the 
emissions associated with the electricity they use. These entities are downstream from the point source of emissions (which would 
occur at a power station).

Issuance type Original issuance Issuances of credits that reflect the first time a credit has been issued for a specific emission reduction/removal activity. Original 
issuances do not rely on any previous issuances from other crediting mechanisms.
Non-original issuance Issuances of credits that are connected to previous issuances from another crediting mechanism. Non-original issuances can either 
be issued via “direct” or “adjusted” conversions. Direct conversions are issuances that are converted 1-1 from another crediting 
mechanism. Adjusted conversions are issuances that are converted from another crediting mechanism but in accordance with own 
standards (issuances volumes might be changed).
Overlap Overlap can occur as a record of eligible credits as a result of the conversion of a credit from one program to another—meaning the 
original credit representing the specific emission reduction has been cancelled or retired in the original mechanism’s registry in 
order for the subsequent credit to be issued.
Country income 
groupThe World Bank classifies economies for analytical purposes into four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high 
income. For this purpose it uses gross national income per capita data in USD, converted from local currency using the World Bank 
Atlas method, which is applied to smooth exchange rate fluctuations. More information on country classification can be found on 
the Knowledge Base, available on the World Bank website: https:/ /datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519.

ANNEX D
Methodologies and Sources
1. Sources and timelines: The State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2025 report 
draws on a range of sources, including official reporting (i.e., government 
budget documents), related legislation that underpins the carbon pricing 
initiative, statements from governments and public authorities, and 
information provided by jurisdictions. Data and updates in the report 
represent the situation as of April 1, 2025, unless stated otherwise.
2. Emissions: For countries, (GHG) emissions data for the most recent year 
(2023), as well as GHG emissions data from previous years, is sourced 
from the EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) 
Community GHG Database (2024),113 where available, to promote consistency 
across jurisdictions. The EDGAR dataset aggregates emissions data for 
certain countries, including France and Monaco; Serbia and Montenegro; 
Spain and Andorra; and Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In these cases, 
the GHG emissions estimate for each country was determined based on 
the relative emissions of each country in the most recent GHG emissions 
inventory reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change or also with respective emissions of the PRIMAP-hist national 
historical emissions time series (v2.6.1).114 For subnational jurisdictions, GHG 
emissions data is based on the following:
 ⸰GHG emissions values for Canadian provinces and territories are taken 
from Canada’s latest national inventory.115 
 ⸰GHG emissions values for US states are based on official subnational GHG 
inventory reports of each of the respective states, available from the 
US Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data 
Explorer.116  ⸰GHG emissions values for Mexican states are based on official state GHG 
inventory data, where available. To ensure a complete time series, known 
annual emission values from official state-level GHG inventories are 
extrapolated based on the correlation of each state’s GHG emissions with 
national GHG emissions data (as sourced through EDGAR). In the absence 
of specific GHG emissions inventory data for Zacatecas, state emissions 
were estimated based on the relationship between Zacatecas' and the 
national GDP across all years. 
 ⸰GHG emissions values for China subnational jurisdictions are based on 
the Carbon Emissions Accounts and Datasets (https:/ /www.ceads.net/
data/province/). This data was supplemented with additional information 
provided by ICAP.
Values are presented in gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions 
aggregated using Global Warming Potential values from Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 (GWP-100 AR5). Consistent with decision 
6/CP.27, parties transitioned to the AR5 GWP values in their national inventory 
reports by December 31, 2024.
3. Coverage: The proportion of global GHG emissions covered by a direct 
carbon price is calculated based on direct carbon pricing instruments that 
are “implemented.” The estimate of emissions coverage for each carbon 
pricing instrument is based wherever possible on official government sources 
and considers the scope (sectors, fuels, and/or gases) of policies but does 
not necessarily factor in all exemptions and/or free allocations. A bottom-
up approach is used to calculate emissions coverage by economic sector 
based on data provided by governments on the point of coverage (upstream 
or point source), overlaps with other policies, and coverage thresholds (the 

--- PÁGINA 79 ---

State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 202579
level of emissions/fuel use/power generation above which the carbon price 
applies). Each jurisdiction’s total GHG emissions from national greenhouse 
gas inventory sectors IPCC (2006 Guidelines117) is mapped to a set of 24 
detailed economic sectors (Table 2), while also removing GHG emissions that 
are specifically excluded from or not covered by the carbon pricing policy and 
adjusting for coverage thresholds. The bottom-up estimates are reconciled 
with the economy-wide coverage data provided by governments and 
overlap between instruments (where applicable) is removed to avoid double 
counting. The results reflect the expansion of the Chinese National ETS to 
cover cement, steel, and aluminum and the removal of the Canadian Federal 
Fuel Charge and subsequent removals of carbon prices at the province or 
territory level.
4. Price: Carbon prices from carbon taxes and ETSs are nominal prices and are 
generally based on the exchange-traded or auction prices on April 1, 2025, 
or the most recent available. Additional price information is further clarified 
here:
 ⸰As of the time of writing, no information on the value of allowances in the 
Mexico ETS is available. 
 ⸰Massachusetts ETS price data is equal to the auction clearing price for 
2023 units from the auction held on March 19, 2025.
 ⸰California and Québec cap-and-trade price data is based on the clearing 
price of the most recent auction, held on February 26, 2025. 
 ⸰Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative price data is the weighted average 
of the allowance transfer transaction prices on April 1, 2025. Prices are 
converted from USD per short ton carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) to USD 
per metric ton CO2e.
 ⸰UK ETS price data is the UK Allowance Daily Futures Price on April 1, 2025.
 ⸰New Zealand ETS price is the spot price on April 2, 2025.
 ⸰Beijing Pilot ETS price is the average transaction price on March 27, 2025.Carbon prices are converted from nominal to real (2025 USD) by adjusting the 
observed value to the base year (2025) by way of a two-step process: (1) local 
currencies are converted into USD using the market exchange rate as of April 
1 in the observed year (using the International Monetary Fund (IMF) exchange 
rates); (2) the USD historical values are then adjusted to a base year of 2025 
using the average consumer price index for the United States from the IMF 
World Economic Outlook Database.118
5. Average carbon prices: Covered emissions-weighted average carbon prices 
are determined by multiplying each instrument’s carbon price in real terms 
(based on average market prices or price levels submitted to the World Bank) 
in each year by the volume of emissions covered in the jurisdiction by that 
instrument, divided by the total emissions covered by the carbon pricing 
instrument in a given year. Global emissions-weighted average carbon prices 
are calculated through a similar process as covered emissions weighted 
average (i.e., the carbon price is multiplied by the volume of covered 
emissions). However, for the global emissions-weighted average, the result is 
divided by global GHG emissions in that year (rather than covered emissions 
in that year). Global GHG emissions are based on data from EDGAR's GHG 
2024 dataset. For 2025, global GHG emissions are based on 2024 levels. For 
carbon taxes with multiple tax rates applied to different fuels or emissions 
sources, a weighted average carbon price is estimated based on the 
proportion of each fuel’s contribution to the jurisdiction’s GHG emissions. 
The share of consumption by fuel and use category (e.g., power, industry, 
transport, residential, or services) was calculated using country-level data 
from the International Energy Agency (IEA) Fuel Combustion database. 
Carbon tax rates for each fuel under each carbon tax were determined by 
converting fuel tax rates provided by each government in fuel quantities 
(e.g., volume or weight) into prices per tCO2e. Norway and Poland include 
multiple rates but apply a single rate to the majority of emissions. For these 
carbon taxes the most common carbon tax rate is used. Both metrics for 
emissions-weighted average carbon prices are shown in real terms (2025 USD ).

emissions will be tracked in future as jurisdictions start broadening the scope of their carbon pricing instruments to 
cover these emissions.

6. Revenue: Revenue is for the period January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. 
Adjustments are made for jurisdictions with fiscal years that do not align with 
a calendar year. For countries with fiscal year running from April to March 
(e.g., the UK), three-quarters of the revenue from the current budget (2024–
2025) and one quarter of the previous budget (2023–2024) are summed to 
estimate the 2024 revenue. For countries with fiscal year running from July 
to June (e.g., Australia), half of the revenue from the current budget (2024–
2025) and half of the previous budget (2023–2024) are summed to estimate 
the 2024 revenue. Where 2024 revenue was not available before the report 
was finalized, official revenue forecasts for 2024 in previous years’ official 
budget documents were used, or revenue is estimated based on revenue 
collected in 2023 (for which there have been no policy changes). Revenue 
values are converted from nominal to real (2024 USD) by way of a two-step 
process: (1) observed revenue values in local currencies are converted to USD 
using the market exchange rates as of April 1 in the observed year (using the 
IMF exchange rates); (2) the USD historical revenue values are then adjusted 
to a base year of using the GDP deflator index for the US from the IMF World 
Economic Outlook Database.119
7. Exchange rate conversions: Price and revenue data are converted from 
national currency to USD using the IMF exchange rates.120 Where exchange 
rates from national currency to USD are not available from the IMF, rates 
from the respective countries’ central banks are used.8. Crediting data: Carbon credit issuance, project registrations, and retirement 
data by project category are for the period January 1, 2024, to December 
31, 2024. Data from independent and international crediting mechanisms 
is sourced from the applicable publicly available registries. Data from 
governmental crediting mechanisms were provided by governments for 
the following crediting mechanisms: Alberta Emission Offset Program, 
Australia Carbon Credit Unit Scheme, Beijing Certified Emission Reduction 
Mechanism, British Columbia Offset Program, California Compliance Offset 
Program, Colombia Crediting Mechanism, Guangdong Pu Hui Offset Crediting 
Mechanism, J-Credit Scheme, Joint Crediting Mechanism, Kazakhstan 
Crediting Mechanism, Quebec Offset Crediting Mechanism, Republic of 
Korea Offset Crediting Mechanism, Spain FES-CO2 Program, South Africa 
Crediting Mechanism, Switzerland CO2 Attestations Crediting Mechanism, 
crediting mechanism in Taiwan, China, Tokyo Cap-and-Trade Program 
and Washington Crediting Mechanism. Price data for exchange-traded 
transactions is provided by Platts S&P Global Commodity Insights covering 
the period from June 2021 to April 2025. It reflects the most competitively 
priced underlying contracts that meet the specifications of the carbon credit 
price assessments. Over-the-counter price data is provided by Ecosystem 
Marketplace and is based on confidentially disclosed price and transaction 
volume information. It represents volume-weighted average prices for 
carbon credits traded in voluntary carbon markets, current as of February 26, 
2025.
