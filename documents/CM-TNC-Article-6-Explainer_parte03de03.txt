31• Standards requirements: The line between voluntary 
and compliance markets is blurring. Traditionally, 
standards that have typically served the voluntary 
carbon market, like Verra, Gold Standard  and ART/
TREES, are now eligible to certify units that will be 
used as ITMOs or for CORSIA. For example, Sin-
gapore’s carbon tax system allows companies to 
meet obligations with ITMOs that may be based on 
voluntary methodologies. Similarly, CORSIA—the 
aviation sector’s compliance scheme—can source el-
igible credits from standards traditionally used in the 
voluntary space. ART/TREES also offers a pathway 
aligned with UNFCCC guidance for seller countries 
to monetize the results of their jurisdictional REDD+ 
programs and has requirements for providing eligible 
units to CORSIA, including reporting corresponding 
adjustments to the UNFCCC. In addition, the IETA 
Article 6 tracker also shows numerous examples of 
countries having authorized individual projects for 
Article 6 purposes based on methodologies normally 
used for voluntary purposes.
• Article 6 requirements: With the Paris Agreement 
Crediting Mechanism - PACM (Article 6.4) coming 
online, the new standards and methodologies might 
help shape the definition of “high quality” in the mar -
ket as a whole, including in the voluntary markets. 
For example, France announced its commitment 
to support the use of carbon credits aligned with 
both IC-VCM’s Core Carbon Principles (CCPs) and 
Article 6.4 methodologies. The EU’s Task Force for 
International Carbon Pricing and Markets Diplomacy  
is promoting the development of carbon pricing and 
carbon markets worldwide, including high integrity 
in voluntary carbon markets aligned with Article 6.4 
standards. Also, the definition of Mitigation Contri-
bution Units under Article 6.4 reflects the fact that 
companies might purchase these units to make a 
contribution to the seller country’s NDC targets.Will corresponding adjustments be required 
for all voluntary carbon credits?
No. Corresponding adjustments are not universally required 
for voluntary uses. Since the UNFCCC does not have author -
ity over the voluntary market, the decision is left to national 
governments, independent carbon standards, and the buyers 
themselves. While some countries like the Bahamas have 
mandated corresponding adjustments for all international 
sales, most governments have not yet taken a position on 
this. Whether corresponding adjustments become a com-
mon market requirement remains an open question—and 
much depends on how the private sector, especially major 
voluntary buyers, chooses to approach this issue.
Are carbon credits with a corresponding 
adjustment higher quality than a credit without it?
Not necessarily. A corresponding adjustment determines 
how a carbon credit will be accounted for. But the quality 
of a carbon credit depends on the integrity of the under -
lying project—how emissions are measured, verified, 
and monitored—not the market in which it is transacted. 
Project quality varies between and across sectors (See: 
Figure 16) and there have been both high- and low-quality 
credits issued in every type of carbon market - including 
the CDM, where double counting was not even an issue 
(See: Article 6 supply ). A single project could generate 
units that are used for voluntary purposes, domestic 
compliance schemes, or authorized for use under Article 
6. In each case, the credit is exactly the same, but the 
surrounding rules and claims differ. This is why standards, 
compliance systems, and initiatives like CORSIA and Ar -
ticle 6 all develop their own rules to define what counts 
as a valid carbon unit. As these systems evolve, they have 
been increasingly converging—but for now, the pathways 
remain parallel, with overlaps in infrastructure and meth-
odology, but variation in demand, use and governance.

32CDM transition: What was decided?
The Clean Development Mechanism, under the Kyoto 
Protocol, was one of the world’s first international carbon 
finance schemes. It allowed developed countries to invest in 
emission reduction projects in developing countries to meet 
their reduction targets under the Kyoto Protocol. These proj-
ects generated certified emission reduction (CER) credits, 
equivalent to one tonne of CO2e. 
Can CDM projects transition to 
the Article 6.4 Mechanism? 
Yes, but the deadline has already passed for most projects: 
projects must have requested to transition from the CDM 
to Article 6.4 by the end of 2023 and the transition needs 
to be concluded by the end of 2025.107 The exception is 
afforestation and reforestation projects, which are allowed 
to request transition until December 2025.108 Seller countries 
are expected to exert significant control over the transition 
process and must apply corresponding adjustments to the 
units generated by transitioned projects. If approved by the 
seller country, projects may continue to use the original CDM 
methodology until the end of the current crediting period or 
until December 31, 2025 (whichever is earlier). After this 
date, these projects will have to follow Article 6.4 method-
ologies.109 This poses a growing challenge ahead of COP30, 
as no new Article 6.4 methodologies have been approved as 
of May 2025, meaning that transitioning projects risk being 
stranded unless methodologies are finalized in time – an issue 
that may become a point of negotiations in Belém (COP30). 
Nearly 1,400 CDM activities requested to transition into 
Article 6 and if approved, these projects could issue over 
900 million units under Article 6.4 for the 2021-2025 pe-
riod.110 While this suggests a theoretical upper limit of close 
to 1 billion CERs and Article 6.4 credits, actual issuances 
will likely be much lower because project transitions need 
to be approved by the seller country – a process which is 
different from an Article 6 authorization for NDC or other purposes. (See: What is an authorization? ) In February of 
2025, a cookstove project in Myanmar became the first CDM 
project to officially transition into Article 6.4.111 This specific 
methodology has received criticism and has been rejected by 
the IC-VCM. New methodologies under the Paris Agreement 
Crediting Mechanism - PACM (Article 6.4) are expected to 
meet higher standards of environmental integrity.
Can CERs be used towards NDCs? 
Yes, although as of May 2025, no buyer country has explic-
itly indicated interest in use of CERs for their first NDC. CERs 
from projects registered (not issued) after 2013 can be used 
for the first NDC compliance without a corresponding adjust -
ment by the seller country.112 According to the New Climate 
Institute, between 320 and 341 million CERs could transfer 
from the CDM with the 2013 registration cut-off. This is a 
significant decrease compared to almost 4 billion units that 
could have been transferred without the 2013 cut-off.113 This 
was one of the negotiations’ “sticking points” for years, over 
concerns that these pre-2020 units would “flood” the market 
and not be considered additional. According to the World 
Bank around 87 million CDM Certified Emission Reductions 
(CERs) could be issued for pre-2020 emission reductions, 
which could be used by countries to achieve their first NDCs. 
It is important to consider that CERs used toward 1st NDC are 
not considered ITMOs. ITMOs by definition are generated 
in 2021 or later, whereas eligible CERs are from 2013-2020. 
When will the CDM be over?
The official end-date of the CDM has not yet been agreed. This 
has significant implications for the financing of the Article 6 
mechanism infrastructure and operationalization, as the UNF -
CCC Secretariat may need to use money from the CDM Trust 
Fund to run the new mechanism before becoming self-funding. 
It is expected that this issue may take the stage among carbon 
market negotiators in the UNFCCC process at COP30.

33OMGE and SOP: What discounts  
and fees apply to Article 6?
What are the various discounts and fees in Article 6 and who 
pays for them? There are two: Share of Proceeds (SOP) and 
Overall Mitigation of Global Emissions (OMGE). Both SOP and 
OMGE are required for all Article 6.4 issuances but are only 
encouraged for Article 6.2 trades “on a voluntary basis”. How -
ever, some countries may require the use of OMGE and SOP 
as part of their Article 6.2 bilateral deals (e.g. Switzerland and 
Singapore). One important nuance is that both SOP and OMGE 
are due at issuance by the seller country, not at transfer. As a 
result, the burden of these fees and discounts falls on the seller 
country, which will likely try to pass on the cost to buyers. At 
COP29, it was decided that Least Developed Countries (LDC) 
and Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) are now exempt 
from paying Share of Proceeds, a move aimed at reducing finan-
cial burdens for vulnerable nations and increasing their access 
to markets. Despite this exemption, LDCs and SIDs retain the 
option to contribute voluntarily if they wish. 
• SOP is applied as both a volume of issued units and a 
monetary contribution ($): For all units issued under Ar -
ticle 6.4, a levy of 5% of the volume of issued carbon units 
will be transferred to a new account established in 2021 within the Adaptation Fund. This requirement is similar 
to what happened under the Kyoto Protocol, where 2% of 
CERs issued for a CDM project activity would go to the 
Adaptation Fund to be sold by the Fund’s Trust, which is the 
World Bank. At COP27, it was clarified that the 5% cancel-
lation applies to all Article 6.4 units, including Article 6.4 
Mitigation Contributions (See: Terminology Box 2), which 
are not authorized by the seller country. The monetary 
contribution was defined by the Supervisory Body and 
approved at COP27 as a set of 5 different fees whose level 
depends on the project size and other factors (See Table 1). 
These fees are used to pay administrative expenses.
• OMGE is an automatic cancellation in volume (not $): 
For all Article 6.4 issuances, 2% of the units will not be 
eligible for sale. Instead, they will be redirected to a can-
cellation account that the Supervisory Body will set up. 
This is intended to increase ambition by ensuring a net 
reduction in emissions, rather than just 1-to-1 offsetting 
of CO2. At COP27, it was clarified that the 2% cancella-
tion applies to all Article 6.4 units, including Article 6.4 
Mitigation Contributions, which are not authorized by the 
seller country. (See: Terminology Box 2)

Climate Policy Roadmap Commission for the Swedish Government at the beginning 
of the current NDC compliance period (2020). The commission’s recommendations 
in Section 13 include the following on use of international ERs: (translated via DeepL): 
“The Government should establish a program to implement efforts for international 
emission reductions under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement during the 2020s, with the 
Swedish Energy Agency as the responsible authority. The program should be designed 
to achieve at least 20 million units from emission reduction measures implemented 
in other countries.” Available at: https:/ /www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/
statens-offentliga-utredningar/2020/01/sou-20204/
Norway: Background: In November 2022, Norway submitted its updated NDC, 
committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 
1990 levels. Norway intends to achieve this target in cooperation with the EU, building 
on a 2019 agreement between Norway, Iceland, and the EU to align efforts under EU 
climate legislation. This cooperation involves participation in three main pillars: (1) the 
Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which sets national reduction targets for sectors like 
transport, agriculture, and buildings; (2) the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), and 
(3) LULUCF regulations, which establish targets for net carbon removals from land use 
and forestry (Norway’s Climate Status and Action Plan, referenced in the BTR).

--- PÁGINA 35 ---

35However, compliance with these three EU pillars does not automatically ensure that 
Norway meets its own NDC, due to differences in baseline years (e.g., 1990 for the NDC 
vs. 2005 for ESR/ETS), and the way ITMO transfers are treated under EU rules versus 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Norway’s first BTR clarifies that target fulfillment will 
occur within the Article 6 framework and the EU cooperation structure. Final accounting 
of ITMOs will depend on future arrangements with the EU and Iceland, particularly in 
relation to Norway’s participation in the ETS. Since Norwegian entities are expected 
to remain net purchasers of EU allowances over the NDC period, as per the BTR, this 
will result in a net acquisition of ITMOs that will be applied toward Norway’s NDC. The 
BTR notes that the final accounting of Norway’s NDC under Article 6.2 will depend on 
future arrangements with the EU and Iceland—especially as they relate to Norway’s 
participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) (BTR, p. 38).
The BTR further states that if EU mechanisms prove insufficient, Norway intends to use 
ITMOs from countries outside the EEA to close any remaining gap. 
The government has earmarked NOK 8.2 billion under the Global Emission Reduction 
Initiative for purchasing ITMOs from third countries. However, the precise conditions 
under which such credits would be applied remain ambiguous, particularly since 
Norway’s NDC is framed as being fulfilled “through EU rules.” The 16.1 Mt figure therefore 
signals a potential shortfall—but not a definitive ITMO demand—in light of unresolved 
regulatory and procedural uncertainties. An agreement is signed with Uzbekistan through 
the World Bank program Transitional Carbon Asset Facility (TCAF), and initial MoUs 
or agreements are developed with Benin, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal and 
Zambia for cooperation facilitated by the Global Green Growth Institute. Estimation:  
With this context, the BTR provides an estimate of a 21.9 MtCO2e cumulative gap in the 
Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR) sectors between 2021–2030, nder a 50% Effort Sharing 
target for 2030. (Table 2.5). It further mentions that Norway has access to 5.8 million 
EU allowances (EUAs) eligible for conversion toward ESR compliance (Box 2.1, pp. 41). 
Remaining shortfall if no additional transfers: ≈ 16.1 MtCO2e. Subtracting the 5.8 Mt 
EUAs from the ~21.9 Mt gap leaves roughly 16 MtCO2e as the potential unmet gap for 
2021–2030 if no further international credits are obtained from the EU. In other words, 
about 16.1 MtCO2e would still need to be abated or offset by other means in order to 
hit the 2030 target, absent new transfers.This estimate provides a working estimate of 
Norway’s anticipated emissions shortfall in ESR sectors if no additional transfers from 
EU countries occur. We have not found estimates of a similar quantified shortfall for ETS 
sectors in the BTR. Assumptions: While the 16.1 Mt figure is used as a proxy for potential 
ITMO demand, some aspects lack clarity from the public information we have reviewed. 
For once, the EU rules do not permit the use of third-country Article 6 ITMOs for ESR 
compliance, meaning this gap can only be closed through domestic action, banking, or 
transfers within the EU/EEA. Yet, Norway’s BTR does reserve the option to use Article 
6.2 ITMOs from outside the EU/EEA if cooperation with the EU proves insufficient to 
meet its overall 55% reduction target.
Liechtenstein: The country signaled intent to purchase 35 kt CO2e.
CORSIA: This demand estimate is taken from the “Interim Assessments in Support of 
the 2025 CORSIA Periodic Review” at the 234th ICAO Council Session from March 
2025. ICAO’s “Updated Forward Looking CORSIA Analyses, Estimation of Offsetting 
Requirements” Mid CAEP/13 scenario estimates a cumulative demand between 2024

67 Data from South Pole. Norway confirms in its recent BTR that “...in the event that the 
cooperation with the EU does not lead to a full realization of the (NDC) target, Norway 
intends to use ITMOs acquired from countries outside the European Economic Area 
(EEA)". It further outlines that "...Norway has established a purchase program for 
ITMOs from developing countries that could be used in such an event. The program is 
allotted NOK 8.2 billion through the state budget.” A volume-based demand estimate 
is not provided as public information. Based on the information in Norway’s BTR on 
the anticipated emissions gap in the 2021-2030 period and an indication that Norway 
may resort to using foreign credits if ITMO transfers between EU and Norway are not 
feasible, we arrive at this demand estimate, which also keeps in mind that the BTR 
states that Norway may use 5.8 M existing EU Allowances (EUAs) towards reducing 
the mitigation gap.

70 Please note the estimate is taken from the report “Road to a Climate-Positive Future” 
(in Swedish: "Vägen till en klimatpositiv framtid"), prepared by the Climate Policy 
Roadmap Commission for the Swedish Government at the beginning of the current NDC 
compliance period (2020). The commission’s recommendations in Section 13 include 
the following on use of foreign ERs: (translated via DeepL): “The Government should 
establish a program to implement efforts for international emission reductions under 
Article 6 of the Paris Agreement during the 2020s, with the Swedish Energy Agency as 
the responsible authority. The program should be designed to achieve at least 20 million 
units from emission reduction measures implemented in other countries.” This is the 
most recent estimate of ITMO demand from the Swedish government.

76 South Korea’s Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth 
set reduction targets by sector in accordance with its 2030 NDC goal to reduce 
GHG emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels. The commission clarifies the target 
for the “international reduction” sector is 37.5 Mt CO2e in reductions by 2030.

3677 The Paris Agreement has not defined or mandated countries to classify their targets 
as conditional or unconditional, but many countries did so. Conditional NDC targets 
are the climate actions that a country commits to achieving only if it receives external 
support, such as international finance, technology transfer, or capacity-building. They 
usually represent more ambitious goals that go beyond what the country could achieve 
on its own. In contrast, unconditional NDC targets depend on international support. 
Given the lack of definition of climate finance and the usual requirement of national 
co-financing, it may be unclear how to distinguish conditional and unconditional 
targets. However, the corresponding adjustment requirement applies to both 
conditional and unconditional targets.

79 Decision 2/CMA.3, Annex, paragraph 1(b)
80 Article 6 requires that all ITMOs must have a corresponding adjustment and must 
be “real, verified, and additional”. They may include both emission reductions and 
removals, and must refer to mitigation achieved from 2021 onward. In addition, there 
are specific requirements around reporting and tracking.
81 For example, the Korea's BTR states that the Korea's Forest Service plans to establish 
a bilateral cooperation system for national and/ or sub-national REDD+ under Article 
6.2 and REDD+ activities under Article 6.4 based on the UNFCCC Warsaw REDD+ 
Framework and utilize ITMOs from REDD+ for achieving 2030 NDC. To systematically 
implement this, operational standards for REDD+ and a master plan (2025-2029) will 
be formulated. Republic of Korea, 2025. Biennial Transparency Report (BTR). Available

set out in related guidance and decisions already agreed under the Convention for: 
policy approaches and positive incentives for activities relating to reducing emissions 
from deforestation and forest degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable 
management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing 
countries; and alternative policy approaches, such as joint mitigation and adaptation 
approaches for the integral and sustainable management of forests, while reaffirming 
the importance of incentivizing, as appropriate, non-carbon benefits associated with 
such approaches.90 Supervisory Body, Methodology Standard, Paragraph 87 and Leakage Standard,

92 According to an IETA survey, 83% of respondents indicated that they would be willing 
to pay higher or even much higher than average market rates for correspondingly 
adjusted ITMOs, as well as for non-adjusted 6.4 mitigation contribution units (MCUs).
